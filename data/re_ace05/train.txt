Head of Iran 's largest daily quits after conservatives win Tehran city hall

The pro-reform director of Iran 's biggest-selling daily newspaper and official organ of Tehran 's municipality has stepped down following the appointment of a conservative as the city 's new mayor , press reports said Sunday .

Mohammad Atrianfar , who had headed Hamshahri ( Fellow Citizen ) since it was founded a decade ago and was a major backer of reformist President Mohammed Khatami , explained that he wanted to " leave the new mayor with a free hand to choose a director " of the paper .

Tehran had been governed by reformists since 1989 , but a conservative city council was elected in the February 28 municipal polls in a result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public disillusionment with electoral politics .

Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad , reported to be a hardliner among conservatives , was appointed mayor on Saturday and a change in Hamshahri 's management -- as well as its editorial line -- has been considered inevitable given the election result .


Founded by former mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi , Hamshahri was quick to become Iran 's biggest-selling daily with a circulation of 450,000 .

Interview With Ralph Nader , Donald Palmisano ; Interview With


Congressmen J.D. Hayworth , Bernie Sanders


NOVAK


Welcome back .


Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country .


President Bush points this way today , even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money , premiums go up and either way , the patient pays .


We 're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader , and AMA President-Elect Dr .
6,6 per|7,7 per| gen-aff|13,13 per|12,12 org| org-aff

Ronald Palmisano .


BEGALA


Dr .


Palmisano , again , thanks for staying with us through the break .


Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else 's lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience .


He was the governor of my state of Texas , where there are a whole lot of doctors .
3,3 per|6,6 gpe| org-aff|5,5 per|6,6 gpe| gen-aff|17,17 per|10,10 gpe| gen-aff

It turns out that he did n't do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas .
22,22 per|24,24 gpe| org-aff

Here 's what the " Dallas Morning News " reported recently : " The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners , the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations .
37,37 per|42,42 org| org-aff

It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors , who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized .


It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors .


Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade . "


That is the Bush record in policing surgeons , why should we trust him now ?


PALMISANO


Well , first off ...


BEGALA


Physicians generally , not just surgeons , forgive me .


PALMISANO


Sure .


What we need to do is to make sure that state boards , number one , have adequate funding .
11,11 org|10,10 gpe| part-whole

The AMA supports that .


If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine .


But it 's also ...


( CROSSTALK )


BEGALA


... bad doctors ?


PALMISANO


Well , it 's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case .


Because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they 're afraid there 's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .


Troy Brennan ( ph ) of Harvard said there 's no correlation with negligence , only with disability .
0,1 per|6,6 org| org-aff

So let ' s look at all of the facts , but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize .
13,13 per|16,16 gpe| gen-aff

NADER


Actually , Troy Brennan , the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits , it 's too many .
7,7 per|10,13 org| org-aff|10,13 org|9,9 org| part-whole

Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice , and we 're talking about horrific injuries here , even file a claim .


Even file a claim .


And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food .


On dog food .


It 's about $ 5.4 billion is the pay-out .


That 's a fraction of physician income .


It 's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion .


PALMISANO


What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here .


That 's what the people in Congress have to do .
4,4 per|6,6 org| org-aff

They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care .


NADER


Doctors are going ...


PALMISANO


But let me - but let me - wait ...


NADER


Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium , right ?


Is that right ?


They do n't abandon their patients , except for the high premiums of a few specialties ?


PALMISANO


Because of the premiums .


But first of all let me ...


NADER


Why do n't you crack down on the insurance companies ?


PALMISANO


No .


Let ' s talk about the facts .


Let ' s talk about the facts .

That 's the fact .

They are trying to do their very best .


It 's a company not for profit .


What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in .


And as far as the investment income , A.M. Bests ( ph ) show that in the past five years , the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent .


Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis .


( CROSSTALK )


NADER


... payoffs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , National Practitioners Databank ( ph ) .


Why do you want that to be secret ?


All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank , you , the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list .

NOVAK


Well , let ' s look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor .


Let ' s listen to what he said to the AMA today .


( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )


BUSH


If harmed by a doc , they ought to be able to recover their economic costs , economic losses .


They should be able to recover non - economic damages as well .


But for the sake of the system , non - economic damages should be capped at $ 250,000 .


( END VIDEO CLIP )


NOVAK


What in the world is wrong with that ?


Tell me what 's wrong with that ?


NADER


What 's wrong ?


Tell someone who had a double mastectomy , tell an infant who 's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they 're going to get dribbled out $ 250,000 for their entire life expectancy ?


Wait a minute .


The head of AIG a few years ago was making $ 250,000 every week .

Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money , though .


Not for you , but for most people it 's a lot of money .

PALMISANO


In California - wait , Mr .

In California ...


NADER


Why do n't you cap insurance ...

PALMISANO


Give me a moment , please .

In California where they have this law , it caps the non-economics , the ones you ca n't quantify .


There are awards in 10 million , 20 million , $ 30 million in California for economic .


So all medicals , all rehabilitation , care services in the home , lost wages ...


NOVAK


No , no , no .


I 've got to ask Mr .


Nader , we are almost out of time .


Doug Friedman ( ph ) , who ran Jesse Ventura 's campaign for governor four years ago , says he wants you to run for president again .


I know you 're saying it 's much too early to run for president .


But one simple question , Ralph , will you consider another run for president ?


NADER


Much too early to consider .


I am concerned about Donald Zook ( ph ) , who 's head of a medical malpractice insurance company , a big one in the West , saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system .

welcome back to " people in the news . "


the intifada , the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the muslim fundamentalism .


in what had been a mostly secular palestinian movement .


the most popular of these groups hamas , an acronym for islamic resistance movement .


in english it means zeal , its aim -- the destruction of israel .


hamas is an islamic movement .


at the very beginning , it was encouraged by israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .


hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from israel , he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s .
9,9 per|0,0 org| org-aff|27,27 org|31,31 loc| gen-aff

slowly it became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an islamic state .


the extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks .


but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the palestinian authority did not .


hamas plays on the palestinian authority 's failure to produce .


its basic message , the palestinian authority is corrupt , it fails to deliver , hamas is not corrupt .


hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver .


unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that funnel the funds to needier palestinians , also serve to support terrorist attacks .


israel and the united states say arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process .


the prime minister known as abu mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli states .


a cornerstone of the new peace plan .


he 's trying to get hamas to co - exist with israel .


conservative israelis are skeptical .


he is not working against hamas , he is working in tandem .


he is negotiating with them .


he is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons , so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to put terror aside .
9,9 org|10,10 wea| art

reporter : settlers call the just concluded israeli - american - palestinian summit a surrender , and were not impressed .


translator : the armed intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the palestinians , and the israelis , and to establish the palestinian state .


hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza .
21,21 org|20,20 gpe| part-whole|21,21 org|22,22 fac| art|22,22 fac|24,24 loc| part-whole|5,5 org|3,3 gpe| gen-aff

we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in aqaba .


israel retaliated on hamas , namely al-rantissi , it missed him and killed civilians .


translator : hamas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated .
6,6 org|7,7 wea| art

reporter : since the second intifada began in 2000 , over 700 israelis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2,000 palestinian deaths according to the red crescent .


including hamas leaders targeted for assassination .
2,2 per|1,1 org| org-aff

if you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process .


i think that hamas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight hamas , if that 's what they are requiring abu mazen to do , they are almost mandating that he will fail .


the main test of mahmoud abbas , will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups , if not , it does n't have a chance .


you know , leaders have to do things

Kurdish militiamen and U.S . special operations troops linked up with more than 1,000 U.S . Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip , as the first large coalition ground force in northern Iraq began opening another front against Saddam Hussein 's regime .

NKorea offers to scrap nuke , missile programs but wants big concessions : US


by Matthew Lee


ATTENTION - UPDATES / / /


WASHINGTON , April 28 ( AFP ) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the United States said Monday .


Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three-way talks between US , North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing .

At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display . " "
6,6 gpe|9,9 wea| art

The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion , " he told reporters at the State Department . "


They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return , " Powell said . "


We are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies , " Powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean , Japanese , Russian and Australian as well as other governments . "


It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here , " he said , referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing .


Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer , and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions .


However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands .
3,3 per|2,2 gpe| org-aff

The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations . "


They had quite a list of things , " State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters .
11,11 per|9,10 org| org-aff

Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance , Boucher replied : " I do n't really quibble with that characterization of the list . "


A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a " concise description . " "
4,4 per|2,3 org| org-aff

It basically listed everything they have ever asked for , " the official told reporters on condition of anonymity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands .


Although the North Korean demands are being looked at , Boucher repeated long-standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off . "


We 've made clear we 're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place , " he said .


Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks , but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing . " "
10,10 gpe|13,13 wea| art

They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another , " he said .


The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing , officials said .


South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis .
2,2 org|0,1 gpe| gen-aff

Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the " verifiable and irreversible termination " of the north 's nuclear programs . "


We ( have ) made clear that once North Korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US - North Korea relations that we had talked about before , " he said .


South Korea 's Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed South Korean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washington not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seoul and Tokyo .
13,13 per|12,12 gpe| org-aff|5,5 org|0,1 gpe| gen-aff

The North 's ruling Workers Party newspaper , Rodong Sinmun , indicated Sunday that North Korea wanted economic and political " rewards " from the United States in return for the elimination of its nuclear program .
4,5 org|1,1 gpe| part-whole|6,6 org|4,5 org| part-whole

Rodong called for a " fair and equal " footing in talks with the United States , blasting Washington for insisting that there would be " no security of the system nor provision of rewards " even if Pyongyang gave up its nuclear program .


It insisted North Korea could do " everything " to defend itself if the United States " legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes " .

Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad


WOODRUFF


Well , U.S .


forces entering Baghdad do face the prospect of urban combat , a type of battle they have trained for , but , of course , they would prefer to avoid .
0,0 per|2,2 gpe| phys

For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat , let ' s go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard , Miles O'Brien .


Hello again , Miles .


O'BRIEN


Hello again , Judy .


I 'm joined by J. Kelly McCann , our security analyst , a man who 's spent a lot of time learning about urban combat .
10,10 per|8,8 org| org-aff

You know , just those two words together , I think , scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong .


You know , I 'm impressed , looking at this map , it almost looks like a chess game , kind of sterile .


That is -- could n't be further from the truth , could it ?


J. KELLY MCCANN , CNN SECURITY ANALYST


Absolutely not .


This is very clean and it 's very orderly .


Suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there , you 'll see just how conflicted an environment that is .


O'BRIEN


And all happening so quickly .


MCCANN


( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .


O'BRIEN


Let ' s roll some tape .


We 're going to kind of play it and stop it , and Kelly 's going to walk us through , I guess , Urban Combat 101 .


What are we seeing here ?


MCCANN


Just there , I mean , just getting the door out of the way , you can see where the weapons have to go .


Now , you just see this soldier right here , he 's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile .
14,14 per|15,15 wea| art

And he 's got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here .
12,12 per|13,13 per| per-soc

Now , he 's going to go that direction , because that room is clear .


Go ahead and stop the tape.As you make every entry , Miles , there are two dead spots , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you ca n't see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that 's always the problem , because as you come in here , you 've got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here does n't get shot in the back .


So ...


O'BRIEN


All right .


Now , what about this , this armor ?


Tell us how they 're equipped with armor there .


MCCANN


Level 4 armor , this is not just for frag .


This will also stop bullets .


And there 's a difference .


The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades , et cetera .


This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet .


O'BRIEN


All right .


Let ' s roll tape and continue on here and talk about -- Now , I notice his hand -- his sidearm is attached to him .
20,20 per|21,21 wea| art

That 's for ...


MCCANN


Exactly ...


O'BRIEN


... ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) ...


MCCANN


... ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) retention , for retention capability .


So he goes down the hallway , and you can see once that 's called clear , straight trigger finger , in case there 's any sympathetic muscle tightening , there 's no problem .
1,1 per|5,5 fac| phys

You 'll see another person come right up here , and he 'll hold on this door , because that 's not been cleared space yet , again , straight trigger finger , but ready to shoot if he needs to .


O'BRIEN


Sort of ready but not quite ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .


MCCANN


Absolutely .


O'BRIEN


( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .


MCCANN


Immediately making entry with the thing , and then pying ( ph ) the room out , getting angles of vision as they clear it .


But look at that , a dark space from a lighted space .


Who knows what 's in the recesses ?


O'BRIEN


All right .


Let ' s roll that second tape quickly , and we 'll show you a couple more tips from Kelly 's perspective .


So far , what we 're seeing is pretty much textbook .


MCCANN


Absolutely .


( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) ...


O'BRIEN


All right .


Now , this is a rural setting , but this could be applied to urban combat , yes .


MCCANN


Very different circumstance .


Same thing when you come into a building .

But stop the tape right here ...


O'BRIEN


Oop , we missed it , we missed it ...


MCCANN


... if you would , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) -- It 's all right .


You can see all this area ...


O'BRIEN


No , just roll it .


MCCANN


... out here .


Just go ahead and roll it .


All of that has to be accounted for as well , not just the space in here .


Your back is not covered .


Many angles you 've got to watch for .


Now , you see right here , he 's got a sidearm , he 's calling the team in .
7,7 per|11,11 wea| art

All the rear is -- Now , stop the tape .


O'BRIEN


Yes , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .

MCCANN


I mean , you know , you 're looking at -- he would n't have a bomb ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) ...


O'BRIEN


No , he would n't have that .


But let me ask you this .


Also that the garb , ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) there 's a cultural issue here .


That provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be , right ?


MCCANN


Absolutely .


And someones might say , Well , why put their hands on their head like this ?


Because , you know , you -- the hands hurt .


And I wo n't be able to determine what you 're doing with your face .


Where are your hands and what do they hold ?


O'BRIEN


All right .


Let ' s roll it real quickly and we 'll make a few more points , if we could .


A lot of fear in their faces here .


You see , by the way , they all have radios , I notice they have , like , a little headset there .


That allows them to communicate ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) ...


MCCANN


Immediate communications , absolutely .


You see them having their sectors of fire .


All these areas up in here , you know , could be subjected to people hiding , et cetera .


Now you 've got people coming down that have already been cleared .


Look at the fear on the faces .


They do n't understand what 's going on .


O'BRIEN


And you want to keep them calm , and ...


MCCANN


Very calm , reassure them that this is n't about them .


O'BRIEN


Wow .


MCCANN


Now , here 's a little bit more aggressive stance .


Exactly .


Go ahead and stop tape ...


O'BRIEN


Stop it right there .


Oh , we missed it again .

Obviously , that person is doing something that that soldier did n't appreciate .

North Korea nuclear bombshell sparks alarm , appeals for calm by Charles Whelan = ( PICTURE , GRAPHIC ) =


SEOUL , April 25 ( AFP )


US allegations that North Korea admitted to possessing nuclear weapons triggered alarm across Asia Friday and prompted appeals for calm from world capitals .
3,4 gpe|9,9 wea| art|22,22 gpe|21,21 loc| part-whole

The admission , according to US sources , came during three-day talks in Beijing which concluded Friday , the first meeting between US and North Korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six months ago .

China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive while officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolving the complex impasse .
12,12 per|16,16 gpe| org-aff|12,12 per|14,14 gpe| org-aff

South Korea and Japan were cautious , with Seoul Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth , it would represent a " major " threat to peace in Northeast Asia .
10,10 per|8,8 gpe| org-aff

US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings said the head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to US envoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclear weapons and hinted it may sell or use them , depending on US actions . "

That does n't shock us , we have been saying it .

Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant , which could produce enough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs , said the sources who requested anonymity .

An angry US President George W. Bush accused Pyongyang of reverting to blackmail following the nuclear admission and North Korea fired back with a charge that Washington had rejected a " bold " plan to resolve the six-month-old impasse .
3,3 per|2,2 gpe| org-aff

The outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into freefall in Seoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any time soon .


Despite the leaked details about the meetings , US officials publicly declined to confirm any of North Korea 's announcements , with US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher saying comments made by North Koreans " require careful analysis . "
9,9 per|8,8 gpe| org-aff|25,25 per|23,24 org| org-aff|23,24 org|22,22 gpe| part-whole

China , playing host to the talks , tried to put a positive spin on the talks which Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said signified " a good beginning . " "


We hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean nuclear issue , " Li was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying .


He said Korean nuclear issue was " very complicated and sensitive , " but the key was to " not mind the other side 's rhetoric , " but " pay attention to its actions . "


A top Russian foreign ministry official called for patience and Britain 's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw echoed the call in a BBC radio interview .

He has made no public comments so far on the Beijing talks .


However US Secretary of State Colin Powell said the talks had featured " strong views " on all sides and insisted that the United States would not bow to blackmail , threats or " bellicose statements . "
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

North Korea , in its first official comment on the outcome of the talks , accused Washington of ruling out Pyongyang 's " bold " plan for peace while offering nothing new itself .


A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman , quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency , made no reference to the reports that North Korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons . "

At the talks the DPRK ( North Korea ) set forth a new bold proposal to clear up bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the US , and the parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula , at the same time , " the unnamed official was quoted as saying . "


The US , however , repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should ' scrap its nuclear program before dialogue ' without advancing any new proposal at the talks . "


The official did not disclose what North Korea 's bold plan was .

For my holiday post , I offer a message of hope for the business world .


In 1994 , I was a graduate student in Boston .
7,7 per|9,9 gpe| phys

I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School .


The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business .


I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic , slightly naive MBA students .


What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent , practical , driven idealists .
14,14 per|6,6 fac| phys

These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change .


I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders .
0,0 per|3,3 fac| phys

Fast forward 10 years .


Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact .


In 2004 , I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School .
17,19 org|14,16 org| part-whole

Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni .
9,9 per|0,1 org| org-aff|11,11 per|0,1 org| org-aff

Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference .


The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship , sustainable profitability , working with passion .


I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world .


These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world .


Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action .


I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools .


It is not coming from the faculty , or the alumni , or the administration .


All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences .


The change is being demanded by the students .


A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway .
9,9 per|5,5 org| org-aff

Few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change their school .
14,14 per|15,15 org| org-aff

Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes , are initiating service projects , forming support group for social entrepreneurs , inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non-profit innovations , etc. .
2,2 per|5,5 org| org-aff|30,30 per|32,32 fac| phys

Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts .


These are not isolated events ... This is a revolution from within .


I have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large .


In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealth of Nations .


I often feel that we have conveniently forgotten his emphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being a good citizen and steward of society .


I am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center .


If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing how MBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .


Happy Holidays to everyone !!

Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark


MILES O'BRIEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT


Thanks very much , Judy .


And Colonel Leonhard , we 're going to talk a little bit about urban combat .


And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that Blackhawk down scenario , Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here .


This is not probably a comparable situation , is it ?


LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD , U.S. ARMY ( RET . )


Not in any way .


And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad , and we will use them .
17,17 org|11,11 veh| art

Those tanks have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them .


The Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns .


That 's a lot of mobile protective gunfire .


Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles .
8,8 org|13,13 veh| art

And we also are not going to use similar tactics there .


We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics .


O'BRIEN


All right .


We want to show you an animation , and share with our viewers , maybe you can point out a few things about this .


If we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat .


What we 've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here , right over here is a mosque .


We depict that to show that 's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf .


As we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this , and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that .

What we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in .


How much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city ?
15,15 loc|18,18 gpe| part-whole

LEONHARD


It 's a great question .


I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that is why movement through an urban area is very , very dangerous .


It 's the side that 's moving that 's going to take the casualties .


That said , the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they 're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will .


We 'll use patience and finesse .


We will take the time to locate the enemy , surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in .
8,8 per|15,15 fac| phys

And then we 'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone .


At which time we can engage them or arrest them .


O'BRIEN


We 'd like to resume with that animation if we could .


That 's Saddam International Airport .


That 's another segment .


Can we get back to the animation .


And I 'd like to just finish this out .


Here we go .


Ad we move it along , you 'll see eventually the troops will come marching in .


In this case , slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door .


Typically , when they 'd assault a target like this , they 'd do what ?


LEONHARD


Well , typically , if they do go in , which is generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we 'll try to go in from the top of the building down .
37,37 fac|40,40 fac| part-whole

One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings , and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill .
6,6 org|8,8 wea| art

So , you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase .


O'BRIEN


Interesting , all right .


Gravity rules , even in urban combat .


Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard , we appreciate your insights in urban combat , something that is not something that the U.S . military would prefer to engage in , but it might become inevitable .
22,22 org|20,20 gpe| part-whole

Thank you very much for your time .


We appreciate it -- Judy .


WOODRUFF


Thank you , Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard .


All of that certainly helps us visualize what might happen .

the information comes from a single source , an interview with a former kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern 's last game .

jfk 's public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life .


twice before becoming president he was so sick , a priest was brought in to give him last rites .


while researching his new book on jfk , dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public .

NYSE Selling Out ?

The market did n't have an intelligent way to react to this news ( except to send NASDAQ , which I 've been cheerleading for a while , up 10.46 % in sympathy ) , but the New York Stock Exchange may actually convert to a for-profit entity .


It 's far too clubby now , and while this move would n't get rid of nine-figure paydays , it might ensure that they only happen when well-deserved .


Not to name names or anything .


The exchange needs this : it 's ossified , the real owners -- holders of exchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40 % in a year ( though they can still earn an income from it to offset the losses ) , and the NASDAQ has undercut their traditional dominance among growth companies - turned-blue chips .

Heck , they 're down to just over half of their single-letter symbols !


It 's a dying organization , and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies .


Full Disclosure : " Far more efficient companies , " basically means " The NASDAQ , " so take it with a gigantic grain of salt .


Secondary Disclosure : You can take the above at face value ; I do n't own stock in a salt company .

I also think that Sears-Kmart should come up with a new name altogether .


Those stores are deadzones , and they need some buzz .

U.S. , Britain drafting resolution limiting U.N. role in Iraq to humanitarian relief

`` There has been a suggestion that the U.N .

What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was `` political facilitation , '' Annan said .

Poliblogs versus Stockblogs

Stephen of IRA-CAM is experiencing Sitemeter envy over all those succesful political blogs .

After all , my biggest surge in hits came from a link from , well , a political blog .


However , I 'd rather not worry -- instead , I 'd like to think of our situation as akin to Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in , say , the summer of 2001 .


Blogs did n't get huge until people saw them updated continuously on September 11th , and during the primaries , and later on during the conventions .


In politics , there 's a definite four-year cycle , and any new medium can find its voice and carve out an audience in that time .


Financial markets are n't so kind .

When you 're blogging about stocks , it 's possible -- though a little difficult -- to say " Okay , you 're right , I 'm wrong .


So I 'm going to sell what I had , and sell it short ! "


And everyone can be reasonably happy .


But a political blog is usually built around a certain ideology , and no matter how compelling you are , you probably wo n't change anyone 's stated opinions ( Instant Counterpoint : Check Little Green Footballs now , and compare that to the September 11th archive ) .

Philippine government dismisses Estrada still-be-president claim


MANILA , May 23 ( Xinhua )


The Philippine Presidential Palace Friday dismissed as an " old tune " deposed leader Joseph Estrada 's claim that he was still the country 's legitimate president .
26,26 per|23,23 gpe| org-aff|2,3 org|1,1 gpe| part-whole

Presidential Chief of Staff Rigoberto Tiglao said Estrada 's camp was trying to revive the issue on the legality of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo 's administration when this was upheld twice by the Supreme Court . "
7,7 per|9,9 per| per-soc|21,22 per|24,24 org| org-aff

This is an old tune as far as the Palace is concerned , " Tiglao said hours after Estrada petitioned the anti-graft court , the Sandiganbayan , to dismiss the government charges against him , citing " lack of jurisdiction " since he was still the president .


Meanwhile , the court shrugged off the claim of Estrada 's lawyer Alan Paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the Arroyo administration was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal 's decision was final and could not be overturned by the Sandiganbayan .
22,22 per|23,23 org| org-aff|9,9 per|11,11 per| per-soc

The Sandiganbayan Special Division Friday reset for June 16 the resumption of Estrada 's plunder case hearing , which was originally scheduled for June 2 .

Estrada , who was ousted in a military-backed popular revolt in January 2001 , has been detained for almost two years at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Metro Manila on plunder charges .

coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants , but offered little or no supporting evidence .


after the first of several trials ended with convictions and harsh sentences , most of the other defendants pleaded guilty to avoid hard time .


march 17 , 2003 -- with coleman 's credibility under serious attack , new hearings for the tulia defendants get under way .

the hearings are stopped when the judge , defense attorneys and prosecutors agree that coleman lied under oath and is a racist .


coleman denies doing anything wrong .

but these men and the others caught up in the tulia tragedy are still convicted criminals .


now it 's up to the appeals court and the board of pardon and paroles to officially clear their names .

Of course , at the same time , though , the White House worries that the American people might see these pictures and think the war is over .

DICK CHENEY , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES


Bottom line , with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm , Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective .


Yet until this war is fully won , we can not be overconfident in our position .


And we must not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to the dictator .

We will not hear from the president today , we are told , but before the week is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president is likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead .


So , again , behind the scenes , a sense of vindication , but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come .

The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks .


They are trying to identify Iraqis from within the country , as well as Iraqi dissidents and exiles , the diaspora they call it here at the White House , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that interim Iraqi authority .

But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr .

Hey , look who got screwed ...


Mark Backer


2004-12-06T07 :33:00


I am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words right now , so bear with me .


First of all , I want to congratulate the Auburn Football team for doing what no other Auburn football team has done ; going 12-0 .
11,11 org|9,9 org| part-whole|19,19 org|17,17 org| part-whole

They also won their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SEC title since the conference implimented the Championship game format .


A year ago , the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook .


Since that day , the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row .


They have now beated four teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played , and two of those games were won away from Jordan-Hare Stadium .


On championship weekend , the big three all played .


USC won by five over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record , and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a UCLA touchdown .
8,8 org|7,7 org| part-whole

Oklahoma played in it 's conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that ca n't throw the ball .
12,12 org|11,11 org| part-whole

The result was a 40 plus point beatdown , but what did anyone expect ?


Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football : beating a team twice in the same year .


With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis , Auburn led 21-7 at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense .


While the Auburn running game was held up , Jason Campbell threw it all over the ball field and , when his receivers were covered , he ran for yardage on his own .
21,21 per|22,22 per| per-soc

This despite several late hits to the head , low hits at his knees and ankles , and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship .


Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown , since the ball clearly touched the turf , and that 's where the momentum of the game changed .


I think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect Auburn 's last title hopes dying as the Oklahoma - Colorado score would have begun showing the beat-down that was occuring .


Auburn was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important game ever , but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it .


Auburn won going away 38-28 , and the only place the game looked close was on the scoreboard .


I ca n't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for a title , but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks that keep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them last year .
8,8 org|7,7 org| org-aff

All I know is that they better think that way next year , because it 's Auburn that got screwed this year .


And what 's better is that Auburn gets to play one of the three hottest teams in the country in my opinion .
15,15 org|18,18 gpe| gen-aff

Virginia Tech is talented , very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country and they WILL come to play on January 3rd .
14,14 org|17,17 gpe| gen-aff

There 's a brief profile of Ebbin by Kristen Gelineau in today 's Daily Press .


What I found interesting was the contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues : " I suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the Legislature , is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about , " said Del .

Protect Yourself Not in San Francisco

From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law enforcement officers , members of the military and security guards .
6,6 per|5,5 gpe| gen-aff|27,27 per|30,30 org| org-aff

If passed next November , residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses .
17,17 per|18,18 fac| art|14,14 per|13,13 wea| art

The proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group .
10,10 per|11,11 org| org-aff

Firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else " actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment , " according to the measure .
7,7 per|6,6 org| org-aff|12,12 per|15,15 org| org-aff

Gun Owners of California , a Sacramento - based lobbying group , quickly called the ban illegal .

Sam Paredes , the group 's executive director , said state law bars local governments from usurping the state 's authority to regulate firearms . "
7,7 per|4,4 org| org-aff

The amazing thing is they are going to turn San Francisco into ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen profession , " Paredes said .


Washington , D.C .


, is the only major American city that currently bans handgun possession by private citizens .

Andrew Arulanandam , director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association , said San Francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model . "

If gun control worked , Washington , D.C .


, would be the beacon .


However , it 's the murder capital of the United States , " he said .
6,6 gpe|9,10 gpe| part-whole

If approved , the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006 .


Quote of the day : " Firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment . "
13,13 per|12,12 org| org-aff|18,18 per|21,21 org| org-aff

So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and protection of the home is not allowed .


No thanks .


If the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and rape rates skyrocket , because burgulars will know homes are not guarded , and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they desire is their own inhibitions .

Did anyone see the Packers game Sunday ?


Mark Backer


2004-12-20T09 :19:00


While it was entertaining , that 's not why I 'm posting about it .


I do n't normally post about pro football , but what I saw deserved a ranting or two , and I suspect it 's going to get many more in the days and weeks to come .


With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11 , Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks .


Coming from the other direction , Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline .
7,7 per|6,6 org| org-aff

Remarkably , Ferguson held on to the ball , despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit .


After many minutes lying motionless on the field , Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher , giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out .
9,9 per|7,7 fac| phys

The Packers went on to lose the game , but that 's not the story here .


This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts .


This was a vicious , arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson 's head off of his body .


The play was immediately flagged , and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected , much to the crowd 's delight .


One sidenote here is that , despite their rabid fandom and the situation , not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field .


It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left , but the Packer fans are classier than that .


To a person , they acted with class , using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure .


This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80 's about five seconds after he had released a pass .


And Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials about Darius ' ejection from the game .
2,2 per|1,1 org| org-aff

I do n't care what anyone says about " you ca n't judge intent . "


Darius ' intent was to dismember , injure or even kill Ferguson .


The more I saw the replay , the sicker it made me feel .


The league must take action , and it must be swift and sure .


I 'm talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary .


In this day and age of bigger , stronger and faster players , injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time .


There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson 's injury .


Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated .
8,8 per|9,9 per| per-soc

Maybe that will tell the Jaguars , Darius and players like him that this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL .


If not , I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter " on the field " with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman .

White House raises possibility it might not seek U.N. vote With EU-GEN -- Turkey-US-Iraq ; UN-GEN -- N-Iraq


WASHINGTON ( AP )


With opposition hardening , the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war-making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .


`` The vote is desirable .


It is not necessary , '' presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said .


The comments came as President George W. Bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war .
9,9 per|10,10 per| per-soc

One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short-term deadline , in a major address next week , two senior White House officials said .
9,9 per|8,8 gpe| gen-aff|33,33 per|31,32 gpe| org-aff

The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U.N. Security Council debate on the U.S .


- backed war resolution .


The United States still does n't have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise .
28,28 per|27,27 org| org-aff

Even if he gets the required votes , Bush needs to avoid a veto by Russia , France or China who all favor continuing inspections at least into July .


Once the vote is resolved one way or another , Bush will intensify his case for war , officials said , barring unforeseen events such as Saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile .


In addition to a possible address , they have discussed a presidential news conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week .


As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , Fleischer told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict .
27,27 per|30,30 gpe| phys

`` The particular package that we 've been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq , '' Fleischer said .


Until Tuesday , the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to Turkey regardless of whether 62,000 American troops are allowed in the country .
21,21 per|15,15 gpe| phys|21,21 per|20,20 gpe| gen-aff

White House officials said they were turning up pressure on Turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the U.S .

request on a second vote .


Even so , officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out , just the massive package under consideration now .


At the United Nations , Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Baghdad 's missile destruction `` a positive development , '' putting him at odds with Bush 's assessment .

Russia 's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov , hardening Moscow 's opposition to quick military action , indicated Russia may use its veto against the U.S .

Both developments further complicated Bush 's efforts to win passage of the resolution , adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if U.N .

position .


`` The president has made clear , that ... whether the United Nations votes or does not vote , that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with a coalition of the willing , '' Fleischer said .
30,30 gpe|27,27 org| org-aff

`` We are proceeding with all the plans for the vote . ''


`` Now , if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it , I ca n't predict with metaphysical certitude every eventuality , '' Fleischer said .


U.S . Ambassador John Negroponte was asked whether the United States would withdraw the resolution if it did n't have the votes to pass it .
2,2 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff

`` We have n't crossed that bridge , '' he said .


`` We believe that support should be there .


We are not facing that kind of situation but we will cross the bridge when we come to it . ''


Afterward , he and other White House officials said the remarks did not signal a lack of confidence in the resolution 's prospects .

Where is Investigative Journalism ?


Will Vehrs


2005-02-27T12 :38:00


Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an effort to do more business with small , women , and minority owned ( SWAM ) firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily Press : Warner 's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .
18,18 per|26,26 org| org-aff|21,21 per|26,26 org| org-aff

The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals are ignoring the Governor 's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office , that " special deals " are cut with non - SWAM vendors , and that somehow the electronic procurement system is " stacked " against SWAM firms .


If true , these are serious charges , worthy of high-level investigation .


What 's missing from the article , though , is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the innuendo .


What 's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether the sagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid .


Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts , then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms were unfairly denied contracts they deserved .


Until then , this carping appears to be sour grapes .


Governor Warner has done plenty to open up the system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage , even inviting a backlash by non - SWAM firms .


Maybe SWAM firms are n't doing all they can to return the Governor 's faith in them .

Kaine a " moderate to conservative " ?


Who is this guy trying to kid ?


Kaine is as liberal as they come .


Who other than a left-wing liberal would agree to represent a two-time murderer ( Lem Tugle ) for free , to try and keep him from getting the death penalty .


Tugle was on trial for raping and killing a southwest Virginia grandmother .

After killing her , he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17-year-old girl he had previously been convicted of murdering .


Tugle was on parole for this crime when he killed the grandmother .


I understand that representing people is what attorneys do but even attorneys have some choice in whom they represent .


The line of defense Kaine used was that Tugle had not really raped the grandmother because " forcable sodomy was not rape according to the law at the time . "

Emboldened by U.N. report , Iraq calls for end to sanctions


BAGHDAD , Iraq ( AP )
0,0 gpe|2,2 gpe| part-whole

Emboldened by the latest weapons inspectors ' report , Iraq on Saturday called on the United Nations to remove crippling sanctions and to ban weapons of mass destruction in the entire Middle East _ and eventually in the United States .


Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N .


supervision Saturday after taking a day off , crushing six more in a process that chief inspector Hans Blix called a `` substantial measure of disarmament . ''


In the past week , Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2 missiles , prohibited by the United Nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) .
10,10 gpe|15,15 wea| art

It also has been destroying equipment used to make them .


Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclear inspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq 's recent compliance .


But inspectors also questioned Iraq 's motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .


U.S . President George W. Bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make Iraq disarm .
2,2 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff

`` Unfortunately , it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violating the demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm , '' he told Americans in a radio address Saturday .


Iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed .


`` We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way , '' said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top-level officials , quoted by official Iraqi news media .
45,45 org|43,43 gpe| part-whole

The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq : to Israel , and eventually to the United States .


The spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said Iraq called on the Security Council `` to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them . ''


`` At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the Zionist entity , '' he said in a reference to Israel , adding that the order should `` move on after this region to America . ''


The newspaper Babil , a popular daily owned by Saddam 's son Odai , also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them .
9,9 per|11,11 per| per-soc|12,12 per|6,6 org| org-aff|42,42 gpe|45,45 wea| art

In a front-page editorial , Babil said the reports should push Security Council members `` to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq , since it was proven that we do n't possess weapons of mass destruction . ''
13,13 per|11,12 org| org-aff

Saddam has long claimed Iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .

The United States and Britain claim he 's lying , and have assembled a quarter-million troops around Iraq for a possible invasion .

Despite Iraq 's demands of the Security Council , diplomats were working hard on very different proposals : a U.S .


- led plan for disarmament or war by March 17 , and a rival French plan for an emergency summit of Security Council members to come up with a compromise .
23,23 per|21,22 org| org-aff

Bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week 's planned vote on the ultimatum .

Inspectors ' spokesman Hiro Ueki said Iraqi workers crushed six Al Samoud 2 missiles Saturday at the al-Taji military complex north of Baghdad , under the supervision of weapons inspectors .
7,7 per|6,6 gpe| gen-aff|19,19 fac|22,22 gpe| phys

Three of the missiles had warheads and three did n't , apparently because they had n't been deployed .


Inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and `` special equipment used to produce the Al Samoud 2 engine '' at the Al Samoud factory , he said , and another group of inspectors verified the emptying of Al Samoud 2 warheads at the Qa Qa complex just south of Baghdad .
46,46 fac|50,50 gpe| phys

Odai al-Taie , a senior Information Ministry official , said the workers crushing the missiles took Friday off because they had worked on Tuesday , the Muslim new year .
7,7 per|5,6 org| org-aff

Ueki described Friday as a `` planning day '' for teams working on missile destruction .


Ueki said an Iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors , bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since Feb. 28 , when Iraq began urging them to talk .
5,5 per|3,3 gpe| gen-aff

Since the same date , four scientists have refused .


Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors do n't mind the scientists tape recording the interviews , a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams .


Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 .


Ueki said inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainless steel containers Iraq says it used to transport biological agents .

Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks


Curt


2005-02-03T19 :53:00


Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday .


It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro- united nations that its almost sickening to read .
6,6 per|8,8 org| org-aff

( hat tip Clear and Present )


One of the hottest stories around , the U.N .


corruption scandal , NBC has been out to lunch .


Why ?


Its U.N . reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N . lobby .
3,3 per|0,0 org| org-aff|3,3 per|13,13 per| per-soc

Linda Fasulo , the U.N .


correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC , has written a pro- U.N .
0,0 per|2,2 org| org-aff|0,0 per|5,5 org| org-aff

book , An Insider 's Guide to the U.N .


, which reads like the U.N .


paid for it .


Actually , the pro- U.N .


lobby paid for it .


In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner 's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for " their generous financial support " of her book project .
15,16 per|18,19 org| org-aff

She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund " for helping to fund the project . "


The book is about " one of the finest and most important governing bodies , " she says .


Of the U.N . chief , she writes like a school girl with a crush . "
4,4 per|2,2 org| org-aff

It is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [ Kofi ] Annan 's performance as Secretary General , " she claims .


His performance is so " impressive " that she wonders if a " cult of personality " has risen up around him .


One U.S . official is reported to be " astonished by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan has been . "
3,3 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

Yup , you read that right .


Kofi 's performance is soooooo impressive .


Gag .


Guess the democrats have their own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with .


Why would an NBC reporter ( who also reports on the U.N . for National Public Radio ) take money from the U.N .
4,4 per|3,3 org| org-aff|6,6 per|14,16 org| org-aff

lobby ?


Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner .
5,5 per|3,3 org| org-aff

Not surprisingly , Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a " must-read . "


Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette , former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N .


who now writes for U.N. Wire , a Ted Turner - funded online news service that covers the U.N .
0,0 per|4,5 org| org-aff|8,9 per|14,14 org| org-aff

A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan 's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .


She tries to blame the U.S . and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it .
9,9 gpe|12,13 org| org-aff|18,18 per|5,5 gpe| org-aff

She admits , however , that , " The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N . Undersecretary General for peacekeeping , " and that " After he became SG [ Secretary General ] , Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies . "
17,17 per|15,15 org| org-aff

Later , " Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly , " she writes .


But responsibility for what ?


The truth is that , as director of U.N .
6,6 per|8,8 org| org-aff

peacekeeping , Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N . peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .
10,10 per|12,12 gpe| phys|10,10 per|8,8 org| org-aff

Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dallaire , the commander of several thousand U.N . troops in Rwanda , sent a fax to Kofi Annan 's office , saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned .
23,23 per|29,29 per| per-soc|29,29 per|27,27 org| org-aff|29,29 per|31,31 gpe| phys|51,51 per|50,50 org| org-aff

The informant offered to help U.N . forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign .
7,7 per|5,5 org| org-aff|11,11 org|12,12 wea| art

All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family .
12,12 per|13,13 per| per-soc

But the general needed U.N .


authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives .


He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous " genocide fax " from Annan 's office .


It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide !


The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place .


Yup , good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide .


What a great guy he is is n't he .


Or how about the ongoing prostitution that 's going on in the Congo ?


Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal .


Yeah ... this guy is such a good SG .


Eff him .


The article ends with the following :


In an April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted " scant mention " to the " plain fact that it was Mr .


Annan , when he was head of the United Nation 's peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994 . "
5,5 per|12,12 org| org-aff|12,12 org|8,9 org| part-whole|22,22 per|27,27 gpe| phys|25,25 per|27,27 gpe| phys

It 's true , Hentoff said , that the U.N .


issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged , to some extent , its role in the killings .


But for five and a half years , he noted , Annan " refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr .


Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N . troops could have stopped the killings if Mr .
10,10 per|8,8 org| org-aff

Annan had not closed his eyes . "


It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan 's role .
5,5 per|7,7 org| org-aff

But that is what she was apparently paid to do .

Shareholders Benefit from Employer Reputation


John A


2005-01-08T13 :23:00


It is just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For .


So now is a good time to ask a simple question : Why should we care ?


Making this list is certainly a source of pride .


It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job .


Should anyone else pay attention to this list ?


Well , thanks for asking because I just happen to have an answer for that question .


It turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well .


In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance &amp; Accounting ( 2003 , 30:771 -798 ) , Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return .


This study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced .


To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public .


The only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public .


This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For information may still be useful even after the information becomes public .


It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year 's list .


Search the news archives and see if in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed off their employees .
22,22 per|21,21 org| org-aff

Massive layoffs , bitter union battles , stopped offering free massages , etc. .


You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced .


That can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce .

What , a Criminal Ignored New York Gun Laws ?

From the Associated Press : A lone gunman opened fire with an assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in upstate New York , wounding one person before running out of ammunition and being subdued by employees , authorities said .

You 're telling me someone was able to take an AK-47 " assault rifle " into a mall and injure people ?!

But it 's New York .


They have gun laws !


And because New York has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from concealing weapons - a gunner can use bag-toting shoppers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shoppers at his mercy .

France & Terrorism


Curt


2005-02-17T12 :37:00


Got ta hate the French , I really do n't think there is anything good you can say about the French anymore , they are a waste and a joke of a government .


Apparently Bush wants the European 's to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group .
11,11 per|12,12 org| org-aff

Makes sense right ?


As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle East , the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over whether they should designate the Lebanon - based Shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization , American and European officials say .
33,33 per|34,34 org| org-aff|13,13 per|14,14 org| org-aff|30,30 org|26,26 gpe| gen-aff|29,29 per|30,30 org| org-aff|39,39 per|36,36 gpe| org-aff|39,39 per|38,38 gpe| org-aff|4,4 gpe|9,10 gpe| part-whole

The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria , Hezbollah 's main sponsors .
16,16 gpe|13,13 org| org-aff

The American rift with Syria deepened this week , with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon 's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday .
24,24 per|20,20 gpe| org-aff|24,24 per|26,26 gpe| phys

...


In the past two weeks , the officials said , France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups .
34,34 per|35,35 org| org-aff|15,15 per|17,17 org| org-aff|24,24 per|22,22 gpe| org-aff

The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the French , American and European officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise , given the new turbulence in Lebanon .
8,8 per|9,9 org| org-aff|18,18 per|15,15 gpe| org-aff|18,18 per|17,17 gpe| org-aff

Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , has told them that he , too , regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East , one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis .
3,3 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff|3,3 per|2,2 gpe| org-aff|8,8 per|7,7 gpe| org-aff|26,26 org|29,30 gpe| gen-aff

Got ta love that .


The Palestinian president admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but the French do n't agree .... No joke .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff|11,11 per|5,5 org| org-aff

The Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as a terrorist group , the officials said .
11,11 per|12,12 org| org-aff

The Netherlands , Italy and Poland support the Bush administration 's view , several officials said , while Germany and Britain believe the issue is moot unless the French change their minds .
8,8 per|9,9 org| org-aff

One European diplomat said other countries were " hiding behind " France on the issue .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

...


A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House , a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe .
10,10 per|11,11 org| org-aff|27,27 org|30,31 org| part-whole|2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff|39,39 per|42,42 gpe| phys

The group could reach no consensus , the diplomat said . "


Nothing is going to change on Hezbollah because we do n't have an agreement among the member states , " the diplomat said . "
17,17 gpe|8,8 org| org-aff

That does n't mean we wo n't get a consensus .


I know the Americans are impatient , but the European Union has 25 states , and these things take time . "
13,13 gpe|9,10 org| org-aff

Some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is because of the situation in Lebanon .


But as The Captain points out , it probably has more to do with Iran :


I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the " delicate " nature of Lebanese politics , but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians .


The EU has tried for the past two years to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their nuclear - weapons ambitions to little avail .
13,13 per|12,12 gpe| org-aff|13,13 per|20,20 wea| art

They do n't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs ' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran can not afford to do itself openly .
15,15 per|18,18 org| gen-aff

They did not learn from Hitler 's Germany I guess , they tried to appease that guy too .
5,5 per|7,7 gpe| org-aff

This whole thing just reminds me how corrupt and useless France is .


They will forever be known as that corrupt and cowards in my opinion .

According to a staff member with one travel agency still doing Middle East business , the increases reflect the rise in oil prices and the increased difficulty in getting visas .

ImClone 's Erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective in helping cancer patients .

The attempt to sell the shares were just before ImClone shares plunged on the news that the Food and Drug Administration rejected ImClone 's application to sell the experimental cancer drug , Erbitux .


This incident then triggered legal investigations , which also included the case of a US media and domestic design diva , Martha Stewart .

Much like the " I told you so 's " everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks , folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts .

It seems that AD and frequent " No we did n't " Ohio State front man Andy Geiger is " retiring " after 11 years at the helm .
15,15 per|12,13 org| org-aff

Maybe it 's me , but I 'm guessing Andy 's tired of putting on TV makeup and going on the news lying about what he or Tressel knew about their athletes in general and their football program in particular .
30,30 per|31,31 per| per-soc|35,35 per|37,37 org| org-aff

It seems that Maurice Clarrett - gate just is n't going away .


Two years ago , everyone was saying " shame on you , Maurice .


You should have known better . "


Now , it seems like most folks are saying " Shame on you both Andy and Jim .


YOU both should have know better . "


Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash , access to cars , etc. .

Now , I do n't expect the AD and coach to know everything , but when a player is driving a brand new car every couple of weeks or months , well , somebody ought to jot a memo and get to the bottom of that .
17,17 per|23,23 veh| art

It should n't surprise Buckeye fans either , since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State , and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well , including ( surprise ) illegal benefits including cash , cars , grade fixing , etc. .
9,9 per|14,15 org| org-aff

Geiger is also tired from saying " we did n't do anything wrong " about his basketball program .
15,15 per|17,17 org| org-aff

Of course , it was discovered that his men 's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit , but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates ... right Andy ?

I only hope that the NCAA will do something they rarely do : make a good sound decision and take away Ohio State 's national title from January 2003 .


It seems they had a very important and very ineligible player that season , and maybe many .
10,10 per|2,2 org| org-aff

I 'd hate to give another title to Thugtown Miami , but I 'd give it to Alabama before I 'd think it was okay for Ohio State to keep .

Vioxx : Slightly Bigger Deal than we Thought ?


Byrne


2005-01-26T07 :11:00


Merck posted a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post-Vioxx announcement .


Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx , representing about 11 % of sales , now represents a pretty severe legal headache : Not only have they lost the revenue , but they 've taken a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses .


If that 's an accurate number , investors should cheer up : Merck 's at fifteen times annualized earnings , twelve times forward earnings , and underappreciated by most of Wall Street .


Full Disclosure : I own Merck .
3,3 per|5,5 org| org-aff

I bought the day of the Vioxx announcement .


And if I want to stay that contrarian , I 'll have to sell only when I get an inside tip that they 've cured cancer , AIDS , heart disease , and death .

If you read the quarterly more carefully , you 'll notice that the charge is not related to liabilities from Vioxx but merely costs associated with legal defense , i.e. , just the cost of paying the lawyers in all of these cases .


If thats how much they 're willing to pay for legal defense , imagine how much the actual liabilities are gon na be .


Good blog , I found you via your instalanche .

Thanks for your compliments .


Usually , I do n't read the filings as carefully as I should -- I leave it up to alert readers , I guess .


Anyway , I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years , get sued , and 1 ) Keep the product on the shelves , 2 ) Remain in business , and 3 ) do 2 ) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits , we Merckers might be safe .

Saddam Hussein is Losing Grip on Northern Cities in Iraq


WOODRUFF


Some pictures .


Well , Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family members in Iraq .
7,7 per|6,6 gpe| gen-aff|11,11 per|13,13 gpe| phys

Mr .

He is also the president of a group of Iraqi exiles , a group called the Iraq National Group .
4,4 per|7,7 org| org-aff|10,10 per|7,7 org| org-aff|10,10 per|9,9 gpe| gen-aff

He joins us now from London to talk about rebuilding his country .
0,0 per|5,5 gpe| phys|10,10 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff

Mr .


Kubba , first of all , your thoughts as you 've watched these scenes of Baghdad , the Saddam Hussein regime falling in the last day ?
18,19 per|20,20 org| org-aff

LAITH KUBBA , PRESIDENT , IRAQI NATIONAL GROUP
0,1 per|5,7 org| org-aff

It is a huge sigh of relief , because it could have been much worse and Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property .


And , obviously , there are four million people who could have suffered more .


So , there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse .


But , obviously , there is a great , great concern about the scenes that you 've been showing on television .


WOODRUFF


Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq ?
5,5 per|8,8 gpe| phys|5,5 per|11,11 gpe| phys

And , if you are , how concerned are they about the lawlessness ?


KUBBA


Well , not in the recent three or four days .


There are no phone lines to Baghdad .


In other parts of Iraq , I received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague , Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey ( ph ) in Najaf .
2,2 loc|4,4 gpe| part-whole|18,21 per|26,26 gpe| phys|6,6 per|16,16 per| per-soc

He was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of the army , but by just a local organized group .
6,6 per|9,10 org| org-aff|13,13 per|16,16 org| part-whole

So those signs to me are worrying .


People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it .


And the more they test , the more I think they are claiming .


WOODRUFF


How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period , however long it is , where the U.S .


is in charge ?


KUBBA


Well , one needs to break down this process into various elements .


Today , there should be an authority .


And it 's very likely that the U.S .


and the British forces are the authority on land .
3,3 per|2,2 gpe| org-aff

And there ought to be administration .


And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis .


But when it comes to government , I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections .


We need to involve the U.N .


We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country , outside the country .
6,6 per|13,13 gpe| phys|6,6 per|9,9 gpe| phys|6,6 per|5,5 gpe| org-aff

But we need to do it quickly , because every day passes by with this vacuum , it 's going to spell trouble .


WOODRUFF


Well , we know , Mr .


Kubba , there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence .
6,6 per|5,5 gpe| gen-aff|6,6 per|7,7 org| org-aff

Is one of them going to have an advantage ?


And , particularly , I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr .


Chalabi , who was assisted by U.S . forces in getting back into Iraq ?
8,8 per|6,6 gpe| org-aff

KUBBA


I think it 's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington .


It 's totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq .


And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington .


It must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq .
7,7 loc|9,9 gpe| part-whole

And there are 22 million people there .
5,5 per|6,6 gpe| phys

It 's not a void .


It 's not a vacuum .


And I think all plans must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality .


WOODRUFF


So does one group have an advantage over another now ?


KUBBA


There are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country .
11,11 loc|14,14 gpe| part-whole

Unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be constructed , maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad , where representatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate , as well as political groups .
36,36 per|38,38 gpe| gen-aff|38,38 gpe|41,41 gpe| part-whole

let ' s talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tragedies .


we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .


i 'll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the " uss abraham lincoln " this is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention .
12,12 per|19,21 veh| art

everybody that is , every sailor that 's entersing the navy does take a swim test .
6,6 per|10,10 org| org-aff

they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .


also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .
5,5 per|10,10 veh| art

they also wear float coats .


you can see them here .


the yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .


everything is color coordinated .


you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .


they also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device .


they have dive goggles and they 're able to find them .


it also has a strobe light and a whistle .


also such location devices , some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate , let the rescuer locate them .


also 24/7 there are individuals on watch .


all throughout the ship , all around the ship .


and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not on entire all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .


now let ' s talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .


you will hear a p.a. announcement around the entire ship .


there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .


a ship - wide search will happen f. they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .


also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .


inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers .
4,4 per|2,2 veh| art

if indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .


if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .
45,45 per|50,50 veh| art

the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .


why call it off ?


there 's a number of reasons to look at .


depending on the water temperature , it 's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .


also the reason for the 24-hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .


anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the " uss nassau " as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .

when he hit the ball , the bat broke .


the umpires found cork in the bat .


it 's illegal because when you put it in the bat it makes the meat lighter .


they hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the hollow sound .


then you can swing it lighter and you can swing it faster .


they took 76 of his bats for analysis .


they x-rayed the bats .


the x-rays all came back negative .


but did major league baseball have all of sammy sosa 's bats ?


we are , as i said , confident , based on not only the presence of security in the club house but also the level of cooperation , the record keeping that we reviewed and so forth , that we have all of the bats .


so i do n't want anyone to misconstrue what i said .


it is conceivable because we did n't have physical presence in the club house that we do not have them all but we are very confident that we do .


i 'm man enough to take everything that i 've done for .


and i still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame .


but the media today , they got it like i 'm a criminal and that 's something that really bothered me and hurt me as a man .


reporter : now , why did sammy sosa have this corked bat ?


well , he says he has it because he uses it for batting practice to put on a show for the fans .


they asked him how many times he 's used it during batting practice and he says three or four times .


that raises the question does major league baseball have a rule about using corked bats during batting practice .

Australia 's first listed bordello plans sex Disneyland


SYDNEY , April 30 ( AFP )


The Daily Planet Ltd , about to become the first brothel to list on the Australian Stock Exchange , plans to follow up its May Day launching by opening a " sex Disneyland " here , the Melbourne - based bordello announced Wednesday .

Chief executive Andrew Harris said the company was likely to abandon plans to acquire a hotel in Sydney 's Kings Cross red light district and acquire another property three times the size in a better location .

18,18 per|13,13 org| org-aff

Renowned Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has been flown to Melbourne as guest of honour at Thursday 's market debut and , according to Harris , has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention to the event . "

Heidi 's ideas , her background , her knowledge have helped us a great deal , " he said . "


The international novelty value with Heidi promoting it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere . "


But it has n't been an easy road to the Australian Stock Exchange since the idea was first mooted in 1994 . "


The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange , " Harris said . "


It 's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it . "


We have fought every institution , every law firm ... it 's cost us a fortune but now we 're going on a massive expansion . "


Harris said Sydney was a more attractive option for the sex Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than Melbourne 's . "


Prostitution is completely decriminalised in Sydney and we are going to build a monster , " he said . "


We want a complete one-stop adult venue -- we want a complete adult venue with adult cinemas , adult shops ... we have found much bigger premises in a much better location to create a sex Disneyland . "

China to build nuclear-powered desalinator project


JINAN , June 24 ( Xinhua )


China late this year will start building a nuclear-powered desalinator project in Yantai City in east China 's Shandong Province , with a designed capacity of producing 52 million tons of fresh water a year .

20,20 per|21,21 gpe| phys

I think that 's a pretty good way to state it .


My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently .


We are trying to pass that on to others .


Likewise , the other government 's procedures , the fledgling beginnings on democracy , and all the rest .


But that 's going to require an undergirding .


Now , in due course , as everybody points out , we may get help from other countries .

No .


Well , what we 've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $ 100 billion .


We put $ 2.5 billion in , in the last supplemental appropriations bill .


So it 's going to be costly .


These RFPs , these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly , and so it 's going to be expensive .


And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States .


Now , I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq , a democratically elected one , that there 'd be more cooperation from the international community , on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that 's necessary in Iraq .

5,5 per|4,4 gpe| gen-aff

State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause " death or great bodily harm , " such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle .


Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the " duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger , including retreat , prior to using deadly force . "

But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place " has no duty to retreat . " "

He said 62 House members , a majority , have endorsed his bill , and supporters include Attorney General Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs , police chiefs and police officers .

I do n't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from a mother 's womb a " child " or " girl " in a society that sanctions partial-birth abortion .


If you ca n't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month , then surely you ca n't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing .


On a less-sarcastic note , I pray for the family of the 23-year-old woman .

the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet .
4,6 org|15,15 veh| art|4,6 org|17,17 veh| art

one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .
11,11 per|6,6 loc| phys

it 's an idea plagued with unsolved problems .


the latest issue of " popular science magazine " takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing .


joining us is the contributing editor .


good to see you , jeff .


thank you .


it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .


so what 's the difficulty in being able to go to mars ?


it 's unimaginably difficult and different .


mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us .


it 's a nine-month trip .


then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .
2,2 per|4,4 loc| phys

we 're talking about conditions where there 's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .


the communications conditions once you 're on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
4,4 per|7,7 loc| phys|13,13 per|15,15 loc| phys

so the -- you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon .


and for now , it 's 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway .
16,16 per|18,18 loc| phys

but as you say , it 's a much further travel .


but let ' s talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there .


the dust , for one thing .


cataracts another .


let ' s talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive .


right .


well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .


you 'd have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .
13,13 per|20,20 loc| phys

so that means we need a good shuttle that 's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft .
3,3 per|7,7 veh| art

then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth 's orbit all the way to mars .


that 's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have n't really developed yet , because we could n't carry that much fuel , obviously .


liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars .


the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we 're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet .
5,5 per|7,7 loc| phys|25,25 per|37,37 loc| phys|37,37 loc|40,40 loc| part-whole

and think of it .


mars is carbon dioxide .


so we ca n't breathe there .


so we 're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself .


all of this is in the works now , but i think it 's going to take quite a few years to develop it .


you talk about the cosmic radiation .


then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .


absolutely .


there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars .
11,11 per|13,13 loc| phys

why ?


during the time in mars .


because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars , the body does n't pick up the calcium in the bones , so it does n't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger .


so they will just lose it .


they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .


jeff rothfeder .


thank you for joining us .


looks like it will be some time before we make our way to mars .
10,10 per|13,13 loc| phys

that 's it for us .


but before we go , a look at what 's coming up next week .


a controversial incinerator just about ready to destroy weapons at an anniston , alabama , military facility .

Hello , everybody .

We will debate all of that as well as " Vanity Fair " 's latest , stunning revelations about Michael Jackson .

France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying , Look , they 're working .


We do n't need war .


They 're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there 's the credible threat of war .


Saddam would n't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he did n't .


BEGALA


I think that 's a good point .


It does n't mean we have to go to war .


But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force .


CARLSON


It means when you take the threat of force of the table , you 're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein .


BEGALA


Yes , I 'm not saying take the threat of force .


I 'm saying we do n't need to use force right now .

Mars rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water


CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( AP )


A rocket holding the first of two Mars rovers blasted off Tuesday on a seven-month voyage to the red planet where the golf-cart - sized vehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water to support life on Mars .
1,1 veh|4,4 veh| part-whole

The rover named Spirit lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket at 1:58 p.m. ( 1758 GMT ) .
15,15 org|18,18 veh| art|1,1 veh|18,18 veh| part-whole

Thunderstorms delayed the launch by two days , and launch officials contended with a last-minute communications glitch between stations that will track the spacecraft .


The second rover , named Opportunity , will be launched later this month , and both are expected to arrive at Mars in January .


Moving on six wheels , the $ 800 million rovers act as robotic geologists .


Each is equipped with a panoramic camera , a camera for close-up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks .


The data will be transmitted back to Earth .


Previous missions have shown Mars had water in the past , but scientists want to find out how long the water was there and in what quantities .


Scientists believe the water may show that Mars once was able to support life .


The rovers ' landing sites , on opposite sides of the planet , were chosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water .
8,8 loc|11,11 loc| part-whole

Studying the minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed , whether they were ever submerged in water , and whether hot water ever ran over them .


The rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet ( 39.6 meters ) each Martian day , which is 24 hours and 39 { minutes long .


The missions are expected to last three months but could run longer .


The rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solar panels and they will remain on the planet .


Only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached Mars , and only three out of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet .


NASA revamped its Mars program after the failure of two unmanned missions to Mars four years ago .


The space agency has been under intense scrutiny since February when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas , killing all seven crew members .

A brave civilian with a concealed weapons permit tried to stop him but was gunned down by David Hernandez Arroyo Sr , the scumbag who happened to be wearing body armor at the time and who also took out his ex - wife over a child support dispute .
39,39 per|42,42 per| per-soc

Nice .


I would n't be surprised if this Arroyo character ( who was killed by police as he tried to flee ) had a serious criminal past but has been allowed to walk free due to our lax judicial process .


Should this be a call for more gun control ?


Absolutely not .


This case tells us two things : that concealed weapons permit holders respond faster than police because we are in greater numbers , and that criminals wear body armor too - so it 's ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw guns that are " too powerful " for civilian use .

Perhaps someone with a Five-seveN ( the gun the Brady Campaign calls the " cop-killer " and is trying to ban ) could have been more effective at stopping the armor-wearing gunner .

Hello Chris .


CHRIS PLANTE , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT


Hi , Judy .


That 's right .


Four U.S . soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division manning a checkpoint near the town of Najaf killed today in an apparent suicide bombing .

15,15 per|12,12 fac| phys|1,1 per|8,8 veh| art|1,1 per|12,12 fac| phys

As the soldiers approached , the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers .
6,6 per|8,8 wea| art|6,6 per|11,11 veh| art

This is something that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place .
6,6 per|4,4 gpe| org-aff

He said this long before the conflict ever began .


He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U.S . troops with suicide bombing similar to this .
0,0 per|8,8 gpe| phys|28,28 per|26,26 gpe| org-aff

Also , in southern Iraq today near Basra , two members - claimed to be members of Saddam 's Thataeen ( ph ) group surrendered to U.S . troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they did n't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering .

At the Pentagon briefing today , General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism .
7,8 per|2,2 org| phys

MCCHRYSTAL


It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics , techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable .


So it wo n't change our overall rules of engagement .


It does n't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care .
12,12 per|11,11 gpe| org-aff

PLANTE


So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles .


Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures .


The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia .


No injuries reported .


The missiles are programmed so that they do n't detonate until they reach their target .


If they go astray , then the warheads never arm but claiming that it 's about one percent of the warheads .


They 've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed .

Judy ...


WOODRUFF


Chris , very quickly , new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein 's ongoing air defense capability ?


PLANTE


Well , no major concern .


The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact .
29,29 loc|32,32 loc| part-whole

The reason that they 're still in tact according to today 's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they do n't turn them on , the U.S . has trouble locating them .
33,33 gpe|38,38 wea| art

They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they 'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad .


Judy ...


WOODRUFF


All right .


We 're paying attention to all those details for us , Chris Plante at the Pentagon .

You 're looking at live pictures of Baghdad where there have been more strikes , more bombs dropped , more missiles this evening and of course as always , CNN keeping a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what 's going on in Baghdad .


Coming up , coalition forces control several parts of southern Iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance .

Singapore extends use of SARS thermal scanners to include checkpoints with Malaysia

Stalemate at the Security Council ; Washington warns it may bypass UN = ( PICTURES + GRAPHIC ) =


UNITED NATIONS , March 14 ( AFP )


Efforts were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find a breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on Iraq , with Washington warning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone .


With marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday to reconcile French and Russian opposition to US - British war plans , the United States upped its military presence , deploying more missile - firing warships to the Red Sea .


Six non-permanent members of the Security Council considered to be in the middle ground between the fiercely pro- and anti-war camps , were working on new proposals to break the deadlock , France 's ambassador to the UN said . "

The six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome of that consultation , maybe tomorrow ( Friday ) " Jean-Marc de La Sabliere told reporters .


Iraq was due to present a 30-page report on biological weapons it said it destroyed in 1991 , according to diplomatic sources in Baghdad , who said a second batch of documents on anthrax would follow in the next few days .

Amid talk of delaying or even shelving a US - British resolution giving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein until Monday to disarm or face war , oil prices in Asia pulled back , shares rose and the US dollar eased .
14,14 per|13,13 gpe| org-aff

British efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mire at the United Nations ended without agreement late Thursday , but with London 's ambassador to the UN , Jeremy Greenstock , saying he expected talks to go on into the weekend .
25,25 per|23,23 gpe| org-aff|25,25 per|28,28 org| org-aff

His US counterpart , John Negroponte , said : " I ca n't say we are much farther along today than we were yesterday , " after hours of talks on six British benchmarks to test Iraq 's compliance with council demands .

The tests were designed to sway six uncommitted council members behind a draft resolution which would declare that Iraq has missed its last chance to disarm peacefully unless the council decides otherwise by Monday .

The two allies would not push for a vote Friday on the draft resolution , diplomats at the United Nations said , while US Secretary of State Colin Powell hinted that Washington would consider not even putting the text to a vote . "
24,24 per|26,26 org| org-aff

We are still talking to the members of the council with respect to coalescing around a position that would n't draw a veto , but the options remain : go for a vote and see what members say , or not go for a vote , " Powell said . "
6,6 gpe|9,9 org| org-aff

We will be examining them today , tomorrow and into the weekend , " he said late Thursday .


Diplomatic wrangling has centred around the French and Russian r efusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the United States to unleash its military might against Iraq before weapons inspections have run their course .


France has provoked Washington 's ire in its steadfast insistence that it will veto any resolution paving the way for war , even rejecting the British proposals for concrete tests before Baghdad had done so .


France 's threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely , British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said . "
16,16 per|14,14 gpe| org-aff

Unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce ( UN resolution ) 1441 , " Straw told Britain 's The Guardian newspaper . "
22,24 org|20,20 gpe| gen-aff

That renders it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome . "


Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov said the US decision to drop demands for a Security Council vote this week on war with Iraq showed the resolution had not won enough support .

He rejected the British proposals , saying : " The British proposals on Iraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem , the prevention of a military scenario involving Baghdad , " the Interfax news agency reported .


He repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorised an attack against Iraq : " It is not necessary now to adopt any new resolution on Iraq , especially resolutions which lead to war . "


His comments were echoed by the German ambassador to the UN , Gunter Pleuger , who said : " There is no majority support for the British proposal . "

Together with our friends in France , with Russia , China and the majority of the security council we are confident the disarmament of Iraq can be achieved through peaceful means , " Schroeder said .

And so it 's come down to this ...

2004-11-08T15 :07:00


It 's Auburn - Georgia week , ladies and gentlemen .


After all the smack talk that 's gone on for the last 360 days , and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season , it 's come down to this .


To stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the BCS title game , Auburn must win this Saturday in it 's 3:30 EST game on CBS against the Georgia Bulldogs .


If they hope to move up from their current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of playing in the SEC Title Game in December , Georgia must beat Auburn .


This game is as good as it gets .


Sure , Auburn 's in-state rival is Alabama , but year in and year out , this game , the Auburn - UGA game , seems like the one that matters more .


I seldom if ever root for Bama , but I always root for UGA to be undefeated when the play Auburn .


The game is big enough already , but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line .


Yes , both teams have other games left to play and yes , other teams ' results may affect what happens to both of these teams , but in just five days , these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season .


So now it 's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shit that goes with this game .


Except I do n't do that .


I ca n't do that .


Anytime I try to talk shit , I get all nauseous and worry about what happens not if but WHEN we lose .


I do n't know if it 's just me or if being this pragmatic is what it means to be an Auburn fan .


I wonder if deep down THIS is what it feels like to be a Red Sox fan : regardless of where you are or what is happening to your team , deep down you do n't just think , you KNOW something bad is going to happen .


Anyway , I am flying my flag on my house with pride and I am looking forward to the game that , year in and year out , gives us the best hitting and mos entertaining football played on the highest level .

The " Twin Deficits " Myth


Byrne


2005-02-04T13 :37:00


According to the usually reliable CNN / Money , the " Twin Deficits " will continue to grow .


Interesting terminology ... I believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?


When analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .


So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers ( who control about 20 % of global GDP ) and everybody else ( excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP ) .
14,14 per|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number ?


Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .


And what about that other deficit ?


It , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .


And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia .
11,11 org|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

So , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) We 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) Would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non - US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?
52,52 per|51,51 gpe| gen-aff

It 's a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal I 'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab .
25,25 org|23,23 gpe| gen-aff

The Twin Deficits are a reality , but they are n't exactly a terrifying one .

It 's not in close .

I knew I could do it again .


But I did n't know it was going to bother me as much as it did .

CROWLEY


Of all the wounds time does not heal , the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict .


RIDGE


It 's not something that civilized people do .


You do n't -- it 's just not -- it 's not a matter of being tormented , but troubled in the sense that that 's not what we do , unless we 're called upon to do it , under the most extreme set of circumstances .


CROWLEY


War may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing .


Training bridges that gap .


Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam .

HAGEL


You are trying to kill people , because the alternative is , if you are in combat , you will be killed .

Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment , but to training .


You really do n't have time to think : I 'm going the wrong way .


I should be going the other way .

It 's just , a decade later , killing still troubles the soul .

Turkish party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan named prime minister , may push to allow in U.S. troops


ANKARA , Turkey ( AP )


The charismatic leader of Turkey 's governing party was named prime minister Tuesday , a step that probably boosts chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq 's northern border .

Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who favors the deployment , hinted that he will reshuffle the Cabinet , but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do .


Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S . troops .
32,32 per|30,30 gpe| org-aff|20,20 per|21,21 org| org-aff

Earlier this month , the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes .

If the resolution is not passed , Washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and for airlifting troops to northern Iraq .

Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US $ 15 billion U.S .

It would also threaten Turkey 's possible role in the future of Iraq .

Russia misplayed Iraq hand , but damage to US relations not fatal : analysts by Dmitry Zaks


MOSCOW , April 17 ( AFP )


Silence is golden -- especially when your hand is weak -- top Moscow policy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from Russia 's vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US - led campaign in Iraq .
14,14 per|12,12 gpe| org-aff

Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin - run forum that countries like China and India that said little about the conflict before its March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits .


Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship with US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aides .

One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UN Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the United States and North Korea because other regional powers ' confidence in Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy .

Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on their nuclear dispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen here as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting .


Meanwhile the European " peace camp " troika finds itself in tricky diplomatic isolation from Washington .

But not everyone here agreed that Moscow 's diplomatic relations with Washington had suffered as badly .

Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin to quickly reassess the quality of his advisers . "

Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to Cold War stereotypes , " said former deputy foreign minister Anatoly Adamishin . "

Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the United States do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible . "


US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington 's anger with European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- and to a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow .

We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in Iraq cheaply and we did not .


We should continue sticking to our principles . "


Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia 's help " to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate . "


Most analysts linked Russia 's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppled regime of Saddam Hussein .


The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt Russia 's budget revenues -- which are heavily reliant on revenues from its own energy exports .


But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin 's own standing among voters will be hurt by Russia 's apparent diplomacy failures .


Putin will face re-election in March 2004 and analysts noted that the war -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by the Kremlin into a matter of national security . "


I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia 's failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- and has not been yet , " said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center funded by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev .

Barry Diller resigns as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment ATTENTION - ADDS details , background / / /


NEW YORK , March 19 ( AFP )


Media tycoon Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi Universal Entertainment , the entertainment unit of French giant Vivendi Universal whose future appears up for grabs .
8,8 per|10,12 org| org-aff|16,16 org|20,21 org| part-whole|19,19 org|18,18 gpe| gen-aff

In a statement , Diller -- who took on the " provisional " role at the top of Vivendi 's US entertainment operations in December -- said his USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of Vivendi Universal Entertainment . "
27,27 per|30,30 org| org-aff|22,22 org|20,20 gpe| gen-aff|35,35 org|37,39 org| org-aff|22,22 org|18,18 org| part-whole|6,6 per|22,22 org| org-aff

My executive role was never intended to be permanent , " said Diller . "


Now that Vivendi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing options for its entertainment assets , it is appropriate to step aside from any direct management responsibility . "


As part of the 11-billion-dollar sale of USA Interactive 's film and television operations to the French media company in December 2001 , USA Interactive received 2.5 billion dollars in preferred shares in Vivendi Universal Entertainment .
18,18 org|16,16 gpe| gen-aff|23,24 org|33,35 org| org-aff|13,13 org|7,8 org| part-whole

Diller , 60 , personally received a 1.5 percent stake in the business and had been touted as a likely candidate to run Vivendi Universal 's entertainment unit in the United States if the troubled French media giant were broken up .

Vivendi , in a statement , said that Diller had , " in full agreement with Vivendi Universal , " announced that he was " ending his temporary assignment as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment . "
30,30 per|32,34 org| org-aff

Vivendi Universal , the world 's second-largest media group after AOL Time Warner of the United States , has been digging out from under a mountain of debt since the removal of expansionist boss Jean-Marie Messier last July , largely through asset sales .
8,8 org|4,4 loc| gen-aff|10,12 org|15,16 gpe| gen-aff|34,35 per|0,1 org| org-aff

Vivendi Universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23.3 billion euros ( 25.6 billion dollars ) for 2002 .


Faced with debt of 35 billion euros ( 37 billion dollars ) in June last year -- including 19 billion from the media and telecoms division alone -- the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its debt by 16 billion euros by end-2004 .
25,25 org|30,30 org| part-whole

Speculation has been rife that troubled Vivendi has been weighing a spinoff or sale of its US film , television and theme park operations as part of its restructuring .
23,23 org|15,15 org| part-whole|23,23 org|16,16 gpe| gen-aff

Press speculation had already suggested that Vivendi might decide to keep its Universal Music division , while either divesting or inviting third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining Entertainment assets .
22,22 org|31,31 org| org-aff|14,14 org|11,11 org| part-whole

Earlier this month , sources told Agence France Presse financial news unit AFX that Viacom is studying a bid for Vivendi 's US entertainment assets placing it as a serious rival squarely in the running against oil billionaire Marvin Davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the operations .
11,11 org|6,8 org| part-whole

While other media companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Liberty Media Corp , News Corp and General Electric Co 's NBC have been mentioned as potential bidders for the Vivendi operations , Viacom is one of the few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a bid .

The college football season is finally over .


On one hand , I am a bit sad because years like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 years , so it 's a little disappointing .


On the other hand , this worked out about as well as it could .


If you asked me at the beginning of the year if I 'd rather be 8-3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl , go 13-0 and finish second , I 'd say hell yeah to the latter .


The fact that pundits put OU ahead of Auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now .


In the end , playing Bowling Green over us playing The Citadel did n't make the Sooners much better .


Man , I 've seen softer takedowns on Cops .


USC came on to the field , gave up a TD , then decided to make Choke-lahoma their collective bitches , and they did just that .


38-10 at the half meant that I did n't even have to hear that dying hyena Ashlee " no , I 'm the one with dark hair and no boobs " Simpson butcher yet another song on tv .

Anyway , I feel great .

Then , the AD and President get canned , a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville , and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things .


He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB 's into staying , then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years , and if Auburn even thinks ... THINKS about letting him go , they owe him every penny .

Sotheby 's , Christie 's pay 40 million dollars over antitrust suits


NEW YORK , March 11 ( AFP )


The world 's most powerful fine art auction houses , Sotheby 's and Christie 's , have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price-fixing scam , Sotheby 's said .
8,8 org|1,1 loc| gen-aff

The payment , if approved by the courts , would settle a slew of suits by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States , it said in a statement . "


Under the terms of the settlement agreement , Sotheby 's and Christie 's will each pay 20 million dollars , " said Sotheby 's , which operates in 34 countries .
25,25 org|29,29 gpe| gen-aff

The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both auction houses to be dropped .


Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to pursue further cases in foreign courts .


The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States between January 1 , 1993 and February 7 , 2000 , and sellers between September 1 , 1995 and February 7 , 2000 .


Similar claims over US - based auctions were settled in an agreement struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars .


In December 2001 , a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby 's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with Christie 's .
6,6 per|5,5 gpe| gen-aff|11,11 per|8,9 org| org-aff|14,14 per|8,9 org| org-aff

Four months later , the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing , which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars .

Christie 's was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against Sotheby 's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent .
11,11 per|10,10 org| org-aff

Together , Sotheby 's and Christie 's control more than 90 percent of the fine art and antiques market .


Sotheby 's said it would record the 20-million-dollar settlement as a special charge for 2002 .


It would be funded in two payments of 10 million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval .

A full-scale military operation against Fallujah , which is apparently underway already , seems to be the government 's ' final solution ' .


I 'm not optimistic to the outcome , especially when significant civilian casualties are unavoidable .


Note , that I 'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas .


Insurgents west of Baghdad have quite obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country , or at least the Anbar governorate , will satisfy them .


They have refused to participate in the political process , they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas , and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves .

The demands were not released to the Iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but they have leaked out days ago .


Here are just a few of them :


- A clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces ( fair enough ) .

It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5 , and came just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing government in Israel 's history on a pledge to get tough on security .

Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row


JAKARTA , March 27 ( AFP )


Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review , prosecutors said Thursday . "


If we execute them now we ca n't bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted , " said Antasari Azhar , spokesman for the attorney general 's office .
30,30 per|33,33 org| org-aff|27,27 per|33,33 org| org-aff

The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts .


The sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review .


President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and asked for a speedy execution .


Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender , Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey . "
15,15 per|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

We are talking about someone 's life or death so we have to be very careful , " Azhar said .


A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court .


Apart from those convicted of murder , 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners , four Indonesians and a Dutch citizen of Chinese - Indonesian origin .

Narcotics abuse is an increasingly serious problem in the country .

Apparently Jason Giambi , recently the non-playing and " sick " first baseman of the New York Yankees , admitted to a Grand Jury that he " injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone ( H GH ) as recently as 2003 .
12,12 per|15,17 org| org-aff

And he apparently got them thru BALCO and ( surprise ) the same guy that is Barry Bonds ' trainer , once Greg Anderson .
16,17 per|19,19 per| per-soc

Since that Grand Jury testimony was given , Giambi repeatedly denied using any steroids , H GH , or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen .


Jason 's brother Jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used steroids .
0,0 per|2,2 per| per-soc

Now , Barry is denying he 's done any steroids and Gary Sheffield 's denying he 's done any steroids , but one by one , the lesser ( and bigger ) players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the public eye where they admitted that they DID do steroids .


It seems that anyone associated with this special " trainer " Greg Anderson is coming up dirty .
3,3 per|9,9 per| per-soc

It 's a good thing that Major League Baseball has such a tough steroid policy , or this story may not have been brought to our attention .


( cough ... cough ... sarcasm ... cough ) .


Never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal in baseball or not .


They are illegal to use in the United States .


I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are .


Anyone ?


The fact that these guys ( Sheff , the Giambis , Marion Jones , Bonds and many others ) are running around denying this shit and acting like Pete Rose did any time someone asked him about gambling ( getting uber defensive , denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking had personally assaulted him ) is appalling .


These clowns are messing with people 's careers by insisting they 're being lied about , yet when it turns out the reporters were n't lying and the athletes were , nothing is done .


I have never denied that Barry Bonds was a special and gifted athlete .


Whether it 's steroids , H GH , crank , lighter fluid or antifreeze he 's using , being able to perform at this level for this length of time defies logic or reason .


That 's why it 's a shame that , in the final analysis , all of Bonds ' numbers and accomplishments are going to be ignored and lumped into the statement " yeah , but he was on steroids . "


It 's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that .


And now , just so you do n't think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above , here 's a great joke I read today :


A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet and says , " My dog 's cross-eyed , is there anything you can do for him ? " "


Well , " says the vet , " let ' s have a look at him . "


So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes , then checks his teeth .


Finally , the vet says " I 'm going to have to put him down . " "


What ?


Because he 's cross-eyed ? " "


No , because he 's really heavy . "


I will be breaking down the SEC championship game either later today or tomorrow , so I expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of your seats waiting for that one .

70 percent of respondents said Bush 's policies on health care were positive , while 66 percent approved of the president 's plan for Social Security .


78 percent said U.S. policy in Iraq is hading in the right direction , a 12 percentage point increase over pre-speech polling .


Overall , 77 percent of respondents said Bush is taking the country in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percent beforehand .

North Korea says Security Council 's handling of nuclear issue is ' a prelude to war '


SEOUL , South Korea ( AP )
0,0 gpe|2,3 gpe| part-whole

North Korea on Sunday rejected the U.N. Security Council 's plan to discuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development , calling it `` a prelude to war . ''


Meanwhile , South Korean officials said Cabinet - level talks scheduled this week between the two Koreas looked unlikely to take place .
4,4 per|2,3 gpe| org-aff

Seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions .


The Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea 's nuclear program on Wednesday , and Pyongyang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tantamount to war .


The U.N .


discussions are `` a grave provocation act intended to scuttle all ( the North 's ) effort for dialogue and aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula , '' a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run news agency KCNA .
34,34 per|32,33 org| org-aff|32,33 org|30,31 gpe| part-whole

The Security Council 's `` handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war , '' the spokesman said .


For months , North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty .


Washington has refused , saying a multilateral solution to the crisis was needed .


The U.S . administration has been pressing the Security Council to adopt a statement condemning Pyongyang for failing to meet its obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms .
3,3 org|1,1 gpe| part-whole

But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S .


invasion of Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international agreements .


A nonaggression treaty with Pyongyang would not necessarily avert war because it may not be honored , he said .


It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for a nonaggression pact .


North Korea also said Washington is `` seriously mistaken '' if it thinks that the communist country will accept the U.S .


demand to disarm .


It said it will ignore any U.N .


resolution on the nuclear issue .


If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S .


efforts to `` stifle '' North Korea , it would leave the North with `` no other option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the potentials , '' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying .
39,39 per|37,38 org| org-aff

For weeks , North Korea has claimed that the United States plans to attack it after Iraq .


Washington says it seeks a diplomatic end , but has not ruled out a military solution .


Last year , U.S . President George W. Bush said North Korea was part of an `` axis of evil '' along with Iraq and Iran , and that it was developing weapons of mass destruction .
5,5 per|3,3 gpe| org-aff

South Korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang .


But officials in Seoul said Sunday that North Korea had yet to confirm that Cabinet - level meetings scheduled to begin Monday in Pyongyang would go ahead .
1,1 per|3,3 gpe| org-aff

Seoul had hoped to use the three-day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world .


North Korea called off two working-level talks with South Korea last month .


Also on Sunday , South Korean lawmakers said they would work to quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the North 's nuclear issue .
6,6 per|4,5 gpe| org-aff

The nuclear standoff began in October , when U.S . officials said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement .

but now there 's been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she 's teped down .


what do you suppose took place here ?


i think many people have watched this stration in action and watched chis tee whitman in action .


the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier .


she was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over .


she was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy , the epa environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over .
34,36 per|33,33 org| org-aff

that 's interesting because leading into it , while she was new jersey governor , she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
13,13 per|11,12 gpe| org-aff|39,39 per|42,42 org| org-aff

let 's hear what she had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing her resignation .


i 'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , i have n't had any .


i report to the president , and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice .


we have have been on the same page .


i was never supportive of protocol because it did n't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned .


i 'm leaving now because it 's the appropriate time to do it .


dan , do you agree with that ?


she says the appropriate time .


do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?


i 'm sure that it was difficult for her personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she did n't see herself being undermined and overruledded .


i mean if christy whitman and the white house were on the same page , i do n't think i 've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big .


over and over there were many , many instances over the last

Joe Granville 's Still At It


Byrne


2005-02-12T17 :17:00


Joseph Granville , the octogenarian technical analyst , has predicted a precipitous decline in stock prices this year .


I 'm a little bearish , myself ( it always helps ) , but I 've taken the liberty of checking some alternate sources for Granville information , from which I get the following incident : Granville 's behavior easily attracted public attention .


His investment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas , sometimes featuring a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville 's theme song , " The Bagholder 's Blues , " on a piano .


He once showed up at an investment seminar dressed as Moses , wearing a crown and carrying tablets .


Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability .


He said he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to have predicted six of the past seven major world quakes .


He was quoted by Time magazine as saying , " I do n't think that I will ever make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life , " and he predicted that he would win the Nobel Prize in economics .


Sounds like a paragon of stability and common sense to me !

Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq ; Any Hope U.N. , Old Europe will


Come Around to Bush Administration 's Way of Thinking ?

Well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : MSNBC , an obscure cable channel , has fired Phil Donahue , the host of its highest-rated show .

Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- " a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war , anti- Bush and skeptical of the administration 's motives . "


So there it is , according to NBC .


Phil Donahue was fired because he 's a liberal .


In fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show .


NBC , of course , is a division of the conglomerate GE , where they apparently only bring right wing things to life .

Bush , Putin pal up after Iraq spat , but Iran row simmers

SAINT PETERSBURG , June 1 ( AFP ) - US President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was as strong as ever , laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war , but barely concealing a simmering row over Iran 's nuclear program .
10,10 per|9,9 gpe| org-aff|16,16 per|15,15 gpe| org-aff

After talks in Saint Petersburg 's grand Konstantinovsky Palace , they also warned North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signed documents implementing the Moscow Treaty , which mandates sharp cuts in Cold War nuclear weapons stocks .

Swapping smiles , handshakes and hugs at a joint press appearance after talks linked to Saint Petersburg 's 300th anniversary celebrations , Bush and Putin set out to recreate the buddy atmosphere of their previous encounters . "


Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it , " said Putin , stressing that despite diverging over Iraq , Russia and the United States had many common interests . "


It is precisely these things that enable me to call President Bush my friend , not only personally -- because I do like him a lot -- but as my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation , " he said , earning a grin from Bush .

But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian aid to the nuclear program of Iran , whom Bush has labeled part of an " axis of evil " that also included Iraq and North Korea . "

We are concerned about Iran 's advanced nuclear program and urge Iran to comply in full with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , " Bush said .


A senior US diplomat said Bushehr remains one of the biggest irritants in Russia - US relations . "

We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bushehr project until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearly understood , " the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks . "
30,30 per|29,29 gpe| org-aff

Our belief is that any proliferation , coming from any source , should be stopped . "


The United States believes that what Iran says is a peaceful civilian nuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture .


Washington has been pressuring Russia to stop building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr , southern Iran , which it has so far declined to do . "

I appreciate Vladimir Putin 's understanding of the issue and his willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential problem , " said Bush .


Putin insisted that the two sides were " closer than they seem " on the issue . "


We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , " he said .


But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie , Putin warned Russia was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran . "


We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in Iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us , " he said .


Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as France and Germany for opposing the US - led war in Iraq , inviting his " good friend " Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington in September .

`` Saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary for people to sell off personal possessions , '' Mukhliss said .


`` Now it 's time to take our country back . ''


There are already tensions between the United States and some Iraqi factions .


Kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand to expand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and Kurdish parts of the city of Mosul .


That could pose a problem for the United States , because Turkey worries that Kurdish control of Kirkuk could lead to aspirations for independence and in turn encourage separatist Kurds in Turkey .

Clearly , their corporate culture has suffered -- 25 years ago , MCI was the brawling upstart in the telecom industry , constantly challenging AT&amp;T 's right to exist , much less to monopolize the phone system .


And now , they 're swallowed by Just Another Monolith .


I expected better -- meaner and tougher , sure , but better nonetheless .

1 day to glory ...

Well , it 's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what 's going to happen in the Iron Bowl , which is just over 29 hours away .


The game is being played in Tuscaloosa , which should be an advantage to Alabama .


However , In the two times the game has been played in Bryant Denny Stadium , Auburn has won .


Alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country , and were ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week .
2,2 per|0,0 org| org-aff

Conversely , Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation .
4,4 per|2,2 org| org-aff

Also , I do n't think Bama has faced an attack with two great runners , a great line , a poised QB and good receivers and a tight end as well .


Bama is missing it 's starting offensive backfield from the start of the season .


The fact that they 've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players .


Alabama simply can not throw the football , which is a good thing , because Auburn 's defensive backfield is second to none .
18,18 per|15,15 org| org-aff

Bama can run the ball however .


Unfortunately for them , with no passing game to keep the defense honest , Auburn will probably stack nine in the box , play man on the corners , and dare Bama to run , and I do n't think they 'll be able to do it .


Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first .


The Tuberville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you 're at home and to quiet the other team 's crowd if you 're on the road .


You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games .


In this exact game 15 years ago , Bama came into Auburn # 2 in the country , undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship .


They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game .


That could very well happen Saturday .


I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than the Bama game .


I live in Georgia , and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the Alabama game .
0,0 per|3,3 gpe| gen-aff

That said , when kickoff time comes , you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and their dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their houndstooth hats and their " Bear this " and " Bear that , " and everything else that goes along with it .


This is n't a football game , and it 's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion .


This is brother against brother after one slept with the other 's wife and then bragged about it .
2,2 per|4,4 per| per-soc|10,10 per|12,12 per| per-soc

It 's THAT serious .


However , when it 's all said and done , I just do n't think Alabama has the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous defensive pressure .


If Auburn takes care of the ball and executes , this game should n't be as close as some think .


My call :


Auburn 37


Alabama 13


Now pass the Tums .


I do n't feel so well ...


War Eagle !!

I read a funny joke today and I thought I 'd share it with you .

A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway .

As he drove by , he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud .


Suddenly , his eye caught something really strange .


He did a double take , muttered to himself and then looked a third time .


He wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg !


He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard , where he was met by the farmer . "

Excuse me , " the traveler said . "


I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs , and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about .


Tell me , did I see right ?


Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg ? "


The farmer smiled . "


Oh , that would be old Caesar you saw .


He 's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart !


Well , let me tell you a little about that pig .


You see that barge down there on the river ?


That 's a mining dredge , taking out platinum ore .


Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up .


Now that dredge brings me in about $ 120,000 every year . "


There 's another thing , too , a little more personal .


One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have .


I passed out drunk , fell down and knocked over a lamp .


That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke .


He came in the back door , got the wife and kid out , roused me up and got me out . "

There is no question about it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily . " "


Why , " the traveler said , " this is all amazing !


I have never heard of a pig like this before !


This is fantastic !


But tell me , how did he get that wooden leg ?


Was he in a wreck or something ? "


The farmer laughed and said , " Well , naturally , when you have a pig that smart , you do n't want to eat him all at one time ! "

So far , the Yukos auction has produced more questions than answers , and so far the biggest of the former is just who made off with their prize assets .


Auctioneers reported a $ 9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company 's main asset , worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver .
15,15 org|12,12 org| part-whole|28,28 org|31,31 gpe| gen-aff

In the latest edition , staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus reports that the Legislative Black Caucus celebrated killing a bill that would have merged the Department of Minority Business Enterprise ( DMBE ) with the Department of Business Assistance ( DBA ) .

I believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt would recommend a merger of the two organizations .


There is considerable duplication of effort and DBA is strong in one area -- financial controls -- where DMBE has consistently had problems .


There would be service benefits to business clients , too .


Nonetheless , the symbolism of having their " own " agency and support from Governor Warner for maintaining DMBE 's " independence " apparently overcame any efficiency and service argument .


Another article , this one by staff writer Skeeter Faulk , describes Sen .


George Allen 's commitment to naming the new Federal courthouse in downtown Richmond for Spottswood W. Robinson III , a noted NAACP lawyer and federal judge .
22,22 per|21,21 org| org-aff|9,9 fac|12,12 loc| part-whole

Robinson worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board of Education .


Faulk finds the nomination a " surprise " in light of Allen 's past , when he " embraced and glorified the Confederate flag and its sympathizers . "


Faulk chalks the naming up to Allen 's presidential ambitions .


It 's tough to be a Republican when it comes to the African-American community .

Will , I share your frustration at the reaction to Allen 's nod to Spottswood Robins .


Among some segments of the African-American community , it is indeed a matter of damned-if - you - do , damned-if - you - do n't .


But you could say the same thing of the Democratic Party as a whole .


I think it 's important to recognize that African Americans , though still overwhelmingly Democratic , comprise less of a monolith than they did 20-30 years ago .


I find myself continually amazed at how open-minded many young African-Americans are .


And I think that open-mindedness goes a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many ( not all , but many ) within the Democratic Party to circle the wagons with the cry of " racism , racism , racism " when the evidence of racism is increasingly a stretch .


It 's like how , after the Civil War , Republicans " waved the bloody shirt " , associating the Democratic Party with the secession and , ultimately , the war itself .


Eventually , that tactic lost its power .


And so , too , will the cries of racism , racism .

North Korea may have fired laser at US aircraft , official says , as North nullifies accord to keep peninsula nuclear-weapons free


SEOUL , South Korea ( AP )

North Korea 's military may have fired a laser at a U.S . helicopter in March , a U.S . official said Tuesday , as the communist state ditched its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons .

No one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident .


North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea not to deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified , accusing the United States of derailing the deal .


`` The inter - Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S .

DPRK stands for the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , the North 's official name .

The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which North Korea was banned from developing atomic arms .


In January this year , North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , a global accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .


A U.S . military official in Seoul , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exported US$ 580 million worth of missiles to Iran , Pakistan , Libya , Syria , Egypt , Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001 .

It also revived its claim that the U.S . military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea , turning the country into `` the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East . ''

Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis , although U.S . officials have not ruled out a military option .

North Korea `` keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S .


drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK , '' KCNA said .


It said the U.S .


invasion of Iraq taught it that `` a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons . ''


In New York , South Korean President Roh said he will never condone North Korea 's nuclear development , but Seoul and Washington agree the nuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully `` by all means . ''

`` It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community , '' he said .

The world is a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafat is dead .


Here is a good one minute video on his great legacy Here .


This guy was one of the early innovators of terrorism in this century and he is protrayed by the Main Stream Media ( MSM for short ) as a " freedom fighter " .


Because of him millions of palestinians chose " jihad " over peace with Isreal .


He innovated suicide bombers and plane hijacking plus he embezzelled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds .... and this guy got a nobel peace prize , what a disgrace .

People close to Fayyad 's investigation told TIME of Arafat 's skimming from the gas trade .


Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption boosted the Palestinian Authority 's official treasury by $ 10 million a month and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians . "

Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark


WOODRUFF


Wolf , we 're going to break in here , because the parents of Jessica Lynch , who live in Palestine , West Virginia , are before the microphones , I 'm told , just about to talk with reporters .
17,17 per|20,20 gpe| gen-aff|20,20 gpe|22,23 gpe| part-whole|12,12 per|14,15 per| per-soc

They 're walking toward the press .


Let ' s listen .


GREG LYNCH SR. , JESSICA LYNCH 'S FATHER


Good afternoon .


We appreciate y' all coming out for what you 're doing for Jessie and all of the other troops that are missing .


We 've been waiting all day word from the doctors , and they have successively done one surgery on her .


There will be other surgeries to do that .


It 's going to take time and patience .


DEE LYNCH , JESSICA 'S MOTHER


But she 's great and she 's doing good .


G. LYNCH


She 's in real good spirits .


We talked to her .


D. LYNCH


We talked to her before the surgery , we talked to her after the surgery , and she 's doing good .


Ca n't you think ?


G. LYNCH


Yes , a bunch , but my mind 's blank .


The doctor has completed one surgery on her back .


They have released the pressure on a nerve , and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it , and that was because she did n't have any feeling in her feet .


So he , he 's pretty sure right now that that will relieve , relieve the tension , and her feet will be able to move .


Also , we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds , and knife stabbing .


The doctor has not seen any of this .


He looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing , and there is no injury whatsoever .


They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs .


She has fractured legs and her right forearm .


And we are just waiting to get that good news too .


D. LYNCH


We talked to her before and after the surgery , like I said , and she 's just , she just sounded real good .


Of course , this morning she was a little groggy .


But yet , she was good , because it was early .


And then this afternoon , after the surgery , she was our Jessie again .
11,11 per|12,12 per| per-soc

QUESTION


If those were n't gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones , do they know what caused the fractures ?


G. LYNCH


They have no idea at this time what caused them .


We know she 's in good spirits , because they told her they was gon na put pink casts on her legs and arms , and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she -- her mind is working good .


So she 's in good spirits , and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow , just as well as it did today .


QUESTION


Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone ?


You said she was in good spirits ?


Can you describe your conversation ?


G. LYNCH


I teased her again about the Army jeeps and she said , " I know where there 's a bunch of that we can find . "

Her parents said they do n't know yet what caused their daughter 's injuries .

Not to be Ignored


Scott

More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I have n't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead , and why I have n't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER .


I did n't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue , but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it .


This is problem that needs to be addressed .


But as for the assault weapons ban issue , the man accused of the brutal killings , Chai Vang of St. Paul , Minn , used a Russian - built Saiga 7.62 mm , SKS semiautomatic rifle .
17,18 per|20,21 gpe| gen-aff|20,21 gpe|23,23 gpe| part-whole|27,27 gpe|36,36 wea| art|10,10 per|36,36 wea| art

As this article points out , the SKS was n't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain " assault weapons " signed by President Clinton .


The ban expired in September and at the time of this posting , no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired .


But let ' s talk about this case , as I 'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident .


While the media use words like " military style , " " assault " and " semiautomatic , " the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle .


The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10 - round magazine , just like the pistol I 'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog .


Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds ; so like my small 9mm , the SKS was not classified as an " assault " weapon .


So let ' s not center our discussion around the gun , let ' s talk about the person behind the trigger .
18,18 per|10,10 wea| art

If convicted of the killings , Vang faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty .

Malaysia 's Anwar loses appeal in sodomy case ATTENTION - ADDS Anwar quote , backround / / /


KUALA LUMPUR , April 18 ( AFP )


Malaysia 's Appeal Court Friday refused to overturn the conviction and nine-year jail sentence imposed on ex-deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim for sodomy .

Anwar , 56 , who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge , now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14 , 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour .


The former heir - apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , who says he was framed for political reasons , told reporters after his appeal was rejected : " You must remember its pre-selected judges , most junior of the court of appeal , and its all scripted . "


What do you expect ? "


Mahathir 's sacking of the charismatic and popular Anwar in September 1998 rocked Malaysian politics , with thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate their support for him .

Within weeks he was arrested and charged with sodomising an official driver several years previously and with abusing his powers to cover up the offence .


The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and the United States still lists Anwar as a political prisoner .


Anwar was told Monday that he had been granted a standard one-third remission of a six-year corruption sentence for good behaviour , and immediately began to serve the nine-year sentence for sodomy .

Daylight Savings Time is retarded


Mark Backer


2004-11-03T13 :00:00


I am 36 years old .


I 've been around a while .


I 'm not 87 or anything , but I 've seen some things in my life .


I have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years , only to have my mind changed later .


However , I will never EVER change my mind about the idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time .


I Googled " Daylight Savings Time " and I got the following link :


http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/


I started reading ...


The site says things like " We 've learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer " and there 's no S at the end of Savings .


It should be Daylight Saving Time .


My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion .


I will concede that " springing forward " and " falling back " are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors .


However , New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing .


I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first person to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies ( oil was used in lamps ) .
30,30 per|33,33 org| org-aff|22,22 per|29,29 per| per-soc

I assume that , because the idea was dumb and inconvenient , lots of people ignored it . "


By 1966 , some 100 million Americans were observing DST based on their own local laws and customs .


Congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country .


The Uniform Time Act of 1966 ( 15 U.S. Code Section 260a ) which was signed into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966 , by President Lyndon Johnson , created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October .


Any State that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law .


There 's a LOT more to this since then , and you can read a lot more it if you want to , but this is what I know :


Indiana 's eastern half does n't use it .

( Do you think the Hawaiian 's sit around , staring west , just becuase they still do n't trust the Japs ? )


Regardless of when I go to bed ( 11pm or 10pm or 9pm ) , I get up at


5:30 and I am fucking exhausted .


How can that be ?


I slept the same number of hours as I did two weeks ago , yet I 'm tired ?


Also , I am so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30 am every day .


I used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon , but now , eating is all I think about after 10am .


Why is that good for me ?


I do n't care if America saves 1 % of its energy consumption costs during those times .


I am tired , hungry , and I leave for work and get home from work in the dark .

Interview With Donald Rumsfeld ; Lugar , Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq ;


Kissinger , Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map


BLITZER


Welcome back to LATE EDITION .


We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
13,13 per|10,11 gpe| org-aff

( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )


BLITZER


I know during the war , before the war , you were very concerned about the position of the Syrian government , cooperating with Iraqis , having an open border , if you will .


Has the situation improved , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state 's meeting with Bashar al-Asad ?
12,12 per|14,14 org| org-aff

RUMSFELD


Well , I guess time will tell .


I talked to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it 's not , I think you need to let the dust settle on that .


He 's , in my judgment , had a visit that was worth doing , and the president asked him to do it , and it was the right thing to do .


We 'll see what progress comes .


You know , words are one thing , actions are another .


BLITZER


But right now you 're open-minded as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other steps that you want them to take ?


RUMSFELD


I know what they 've been doing , and it 's been unhelpful .


I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful , and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future .
4,4 per|7,7 gpe| phys

In my view , they were making some unwise decisions previously .


What they 'll do after this visit remains to be seen .


BLITZER


The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending , those detained at the U.S . Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , about 600 or so of them .
1,1 per|3,3 org| org-aff|27,27 per|34,34 fac| phys|31,31 gpe|34,34 fac| art|36,37 loc|39,39 gpe| part-whole|34,34 fac|36,37 loc| part-whole

Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals ?


RUMSFELD


I do n't think that 's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about .


BLITZER


All right , tell me what ...


RUMSFELD


I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter - agency process , where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and DIA , and what have you , involved in interrogating these detainees , it takes time to find out what intelligence they have .
22,22 org|22,22 org| org-aff|24,24 org|24,24 org| org-aff|28,28 org|28,28 org| org-aff|33,33 per|30,30 org| org-aff

It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate , and what Colin and I have been concerned about , both of us , is that it 's taking so long .


There are a number of countries , and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries , that have foreign nationals in Gitmo , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , being detained , and those countries , understandably , would like to know when they could have those people .
29,30 loc|32,32 gpe| part-whole|24,24 per|21,21 gpe| gen-aff|24,24 per|29,30 loc| phys

So the inter - agency process takes a great deal of time .


Colin and I are trying to speed up that process , and that 's what that 's all about .


BLITZER


Let me just , a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go .


Victory parades for the troops .


I remember covering General Schwarzkopf , the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War .


Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back , to have parades in New York , Washington , elsewhere ?


RUMSFELD


There 's no question but that the troops , the young men and women , did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them , and there will be .


And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world , and indeed for the Iraqi people , who have been liberated .


What 's the best way to do that ?


In the case of 1991 , the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait , and they did it , and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States .
14,14 per|17,17 gpe| phys|25,25 per|33,34 gpe| phys

In this instance , it was a very different task .


It was to remove that regime , and it 's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over .


We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist , that work with those global networks .
15,15 per|16,16 gpe| gen-aff

And on the one hand we will , in fact , find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women , and we 'll do it well .


Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing , I do n't know .


I kind of doubt it , because it 's such a different circumstance .


Certainly , our war plan was not modeled off of 1991 .


BLITZER


One final question on North Korea .


If the North Koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions ...


RUMSFELD


Yes .


BLITZER


... a preemptive strike , is that something that is out there ?


RUMSFELD


I 'm not one who speculates about things like that .


I know that back in the 1990s , in the Clinton administration , Secretary Perry called in the former secretaries of defense , and we had a discussion , and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering , and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate .
10,10 per|11,11 org| org-aff

But those are very serious issues , and I leave them for the president .

The ruling by judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa of the Supreme Court of Appeal , the highest appeals court in the country , means that Basson can not be tried again and his acquittal stands , the South African Press Association reported .

The state 's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself during Basson 's 2 1/2 - year trial .


The prosecution alleged presiding Judge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson .


The appeal judges found Hartzenberg 's refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part .


Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980 's .


During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying to create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would only affect blacks .


They poisoned opponents ' clothing and stockpiled cholera , HIV and anthrax .


The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandela and several African National Congress leaders who are now high-ranking government officials .

The decision was made in response to the recommendation of Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla .


Kostelka , 52 , was first deputy defense minister and an ex - general .


At the end of last month , Tvrdik submitted his resignation in protest against planned cuts in defense spending as part of the government 's finance reforms .


Under the planned package of public finance reforms , only 2.05 percent of the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be allocated for the defense budget .


Tvrdik said the military reform could not be completed thoroughly with so little money .


Tvrdik , who took over the defense ministry in May 2001 , also announced that he would quit his post in the parliament and give up his position in the ruling party Social Democrats .

In a likely reference to North Korea 's demand for a nonaggression treaty with Washington , KCNA said : `` The U.S .


should settle the talks from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue . ''


Washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it would consider some sort of written assurance .


The North also likely wants aid for its economy , which has been crippled by the loss of Soviet subsidies and years of drought and mismanagement .


North Korea and China fought against the United States in the 1950-53 Korean War , which ended without a peace treaty .


North Korea and Washington have no formal relations and are still technically at war .

Please , someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers ( Delta , US Airways , Continental , American , Northwestern , United ) .


High fuel costs , insane pension obligations , and a highly paid , specialized workforce .


To this list of woes , we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures .


I admit I 've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies .


Unfortunately , the pain is not limited to these companies .


Pittsburgh , one of US Airway 's hubs , built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal .
12,12 fac|11,11 gpe| part-whole|18,18 fac|21,21 fac| part-whole|18,18 fac|12,12 fac| part-whole

Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28 % since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely .


These shiny new airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have to paid off ... but not by the airlines .


This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy .


Southwest and JetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years .


So I will thankfully accept the low fares , bemoan the loss of food on flights , and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy .

Russia accepts World Bank loan to combat AIDS , tuberculosis


MOSCOW ( AP )


Russia has accepted a US$ 150 million World Bank loan to combat the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis , ending a negotiating process that lasted four years , World Bank officials said Friday .
30,30 per|28,29 org| org-aff

The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999 , but disagreements over treatment kept the project on hold .


Russia objected to World Bank rules that required monitoring of patients receiving medication , the World Bank said .
10,10 per|0,0 gpe| gen-aff

But after drawn-out talks , President Vladimir Putin signed off on the loan , which will take effect this year , the World Bank said .


`` Russia has one of the fastest growing AIDS epidemics in the world '' and has a `` fearsome '' problem with tuberculosis , particularly drug-resistant strains , said Olesoji Adeyi , a World Bank health specialist .
36,36 per|33,34 org| org-aff|1,1 gpe|12,12 loc| part-whole

`` It 's a potential dual epidemic , '' he said , adding that people with immune systems weakened by the AIDS virus are especially vulnerable to contracting TB , which he called an `` opportunistic disease . ''


AIDS came relatively late to Russia , but spread rapidly , primarily due to intravenous drug abuse and a lack of prevention programs .


Officials have registered more than 230,000 cases of HIV , though health experts say the actual number of HIV infections tops 1 million .


Tuberculosis , meanwhile , has also emerged as a serious problem , particularly in Russia 's overcrowded prisons .

One of the rules of thumb that has guided my ( limited ) business career from the beginning is that China is never as lucrative as it looks .


This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history , including several booms in interest and investment in China .


Their biggest problem : There 's usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly Starving Peasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees .

Specifically , they did n't have a real middle class .


That 's changed in the last twenty years , as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made China a genuine , rather than theoretical , contender .


And they 've even supplied proof of their economic viability , announcing that they 've beaten Japan for exports to the US .

then created an office of the chairman in 2002 , which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak .


Both are considered possible successors , but the board wo n't know Greenberg 's preference until his departure , when it opens a sealed letter .


Perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher .... The CEO works for the board ... end lesson .
12,12 per|16,16 per| per-soc

I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders .


It would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I do n't really believe that .


I know CEO / chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance .


However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way .


Having a combined CEO/Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team .


This downside of having a combined CEO/chair is offset by ( 1 ) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and ( 2 ) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc. # 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .


I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a CEO/Chair before investing .
16,16 per|13,13 org| org-aff|10,10 per|13,13 org| org-aff

It is important that you can get a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO .


Is there high turnover among senior managers ?


Is there a record of regulatory problems ?


If the CEO is new , I also look at the performance of the CEO 's previous company .
14,14 per|17,17 org| org-aff

I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left .

Paul , as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office .


Now in your administration , the Clinton administration , there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen , Les Aspin , William S. Cohen , Janet Reno , Bruce Babbitt , Mike Espy , Dan Glickman , Norman Mineta , Henry Cisneros , Federico Pena , Bill Richardson , Richard Riley , 12 of them , not to mention former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown , and one of the great professional politicians of all time , Bill Daly .

Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich .

Anti-Gerrymandering : Is Virginia Ready ?


Will Vehrs


2005-02-17T07 :44:00


Many of the good - governiks who write for Bacon 's Rebellion have pointed out the deleterious effects of gerrymandering on Virginia .
6,6 per|9,11 org| org-aff

Some would say the problems are on display in Capitol Square right now .


There 's an anti-gerrymandering movement gaining a small head of steam in California .


The Golden State often leads the way for the nation on " reform , " for good or ill .


Mickey Kaus of Slate reminds us that the California initiative bears watching and we should follow the motives of those who support or oppose the current redistricting process .

Mickey cites two Stuart Taylor articles on the subject that should be required reading for any who would debate the issue , here and here .

Hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process , we shoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the state House and Senate .
23,23 org|22,22 gpe| org-aff|25,25 org|22,22 gpe| org-aff

Currently , each House member represents approximately 75,000 Virginians , while each Senator represents appoximately 187,500 .
4,4 per|3,3 org| org-aff

Often as not , there is no rational commonality between the two .


Some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six House districts .


I believe this accounts , in large part , for the dysfunction that characterizes our state government now .


Former Governor Gerald Baliles , in this same vein , has advocated a realignment of the two houses in a way that serves commonalities .


He has suggested that we either increase membership in the Senate to 50 , or decrease House membership to 80 , producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates .
7,7 per|10,10 org| org-aff|17,17 per|16,16 org| org-aff

He thinks -- and I think he is right -- that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the Senate and the House .


You certainly would n't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have , where 1 Senator often represents a population divided among half a dozen Delegates of two parties -- three , if you count independents .

Democrats Finally Getting it Right on Abortion ?


Scott


2004-12-23T14 :49:00


This is absolutely amazing news .


Finally , the Democrats are finally realizing that the American people support the rights of unborn children and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values that at least half of this country possesses .
32,32 per|35,35 gpe| gen-aff

Of course , I 'm sure the Democrats would also like to start winning elections again .


From the Los Angeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of abortion rights , the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader array of voters .


The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National , particularly between two leading candidates : former Vermont Gov .
23,23 per|22,22 gpe| org-aff

Howard Dean , who supports abortion rights , and former Indiana Rep .
11,11 per|10,10 gpe| org-aff

Tim Roemer , an abortion foe who argues that the party can not rebound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society 's most emotional conflicts .


No Democrat with any respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean 's name again .
6,6 per|8,8 org| org-aff

The fact that he did n't win a single primary outside his home state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism .
11,11 per|13,13 gpe| gen-aff

Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood , which gives a lot of money to Democrats , will fight with everything they 've got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible .


Results from the last few elections suggest that would n't be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress .

Gmail : Cachet for Everybody !


Byrne


2005-02-06T19 :51:00


At first , I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of something new , cool , and free , from a quirky company , on April Fool 's Day ?


Turns out my initial attitude was n't justified , of course , and Gmail has been a popular success .


Just this weekend , Google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail 's final move out of beta .


Their marketing was absolutely brilliant : Simply through association with Google , and because of the invitation-only membership , they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $ 50 on eBay , and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite .


And now ?


Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one , and yet people with invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away .


It 's been nearly a year , the service is nearly ubiquitous , and somehow Google has kept us obsessed with Gmail .


Want an invite ?


I 've got a dozen .

Beyond Hippies and Tree Huggers

Socially responsible investing .


Corporate social responsibility .


Just saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk reactions .


The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy .


You know , the one that says " Poor naive soul .


If only you understood economics , you would understand the folly of your ways . "


I do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged .


Those discussions , though interesting , avoid a simpler question .


Do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments ?


If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business Week or The Wall Street Journal , you 've probably heard the standard answer -- the evidence is mixed .


That is true but not very revealing would n't you say ?


Evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together .


Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced .


There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime .


Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion .


Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components , you start to see the valuable information .


Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform , as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers .
4,4 per|0,0 org| org-aff

On the other hand , companies with numerous NLRB violations do n't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical " sin " products ( tobacco , firearms , gambling ) can be excellent investments .
18,18 org|30,30 wea| art

Lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results .


Taken separately , they provide valuable information about future firm performance .


I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion .


Though that would make a great Celebrity Death Match episode .


Here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject .

Report : Accident on Chinese submarine kills all 70 aboard


BEIJING ( AP )


An accident on a diesel-powered Chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard , the official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday .
11,11 per|6,6 veh| art|13,13 per|6,6 veh| art|5,5 gpe|6,6 veh| art

The accident occurred `` recently '' in Chinese waters east of the Neichangshan islands , the brief Chinese-language report said .

The islands are in the Yellow Sea , between the northeastern province of Liaoning and North Korea .
1,1 loc|5,6 loc| part-whole|5,6 loc|11,11 gpe| phys|5,6 loc|15,16 gpe| phys

The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred , and `` because of a mechanical malfunction , the 70 crew members on board died , '' the Xinhua report said .
22,22 per|1,1 veh| art

It did not give further details or say how the crew died .


The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port , Xinhua said .


It said the hull number was 361 , which military analysts said appeared to make it a Ming - class submarine , a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense .


The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents .


It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap , said Bernard Cole , a professor at the U.N . National War College in Washington and a specialist on the Chinese navy .
23,25 org|21,21 gpe| gen-aff|18,18 per|23,25 org| org-aff|23,25 org|27,27 gpe| gen-aff|34,34 org|33,33 gpe| part-whole

`` There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines , but this is the first fatal accident that I know of , '' said Cole .


China 's military , which has a tradition of secrecy , did not comment about the accident Friday night .
2,2 org|0,0 gpe| part-whole

Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered .
17,17 per|16,16 veh| art

They suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes .


Michael McGinty , an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London , said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface .
8,8 org|7,7 gpe| part-whole|4,4 per|11,17 org| org-aff|11,17 org|19,19 gpe| gen-aff

If the accident happened when the vessel was underwater , it was less likely that China could have recovered it , said McGinty , a former British submariner .
27,27 per|26,26 gpe| org-aff

`` For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface , I find it a very mysterious thing , '' he said .


McGinty said that the submarine 's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater , creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew .


The torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned the crew , he said .


The accident could have occurred as long ago as March , said Cole , a former U.S . Navy antisubmarine warfare officer .
18,18 org|16,16 gpe| part-whole|21,21 per|18,18 org| org-aff

`` There have been exercises going on in the Yellow Sea over the past two months , '' he said .


`` This boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago . ''


Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem .


He said Ming - class subs usually carry a crew of 50 , suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers .
9,9 per|5,5 veh| art

China began building the Ming - class subs in the 1970s , and they are obsolete by modern standards , according to the Federation of American Scientists .

The first three Ming - class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979 , and one of them was scrapped after a fire , according to the Web site of Jane 's Information Group , a leading of source defense information .

China 's submarine fleet includes 66 boats , most of them aging diesel-electric vessels , McGinty said .

He said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money , training and maintenance .


But the Chinese are aggressively updating their fleet with Russian - made Kilo - class diesel-electric subs .

`` The submarine force is the most potent part of the Chinese navy , '' said Cole .

Despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet , subs are valuable because they are hard to detect , Cole said .


In a conflict over Taiwan or some other confrontation , he said , `` China 's ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force . ''


Xinhua said former President Jiang Zemin , who is chairman of the commission that runs China 's military , on Friday sent condolences to family members of the crew .

Now We 'll Just Kill Boys

The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more than one child .


As a result , only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys , because couples traditionally favor males .
16,16 per|19,19 per| per-soc

Beijing has set a goal of reversing the imbalance by 2010 , and to do this they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fetuses to correct an imbalance in the ratio of boys to girls .


So now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap .


What a country !


From Reuters : Sex-selective abortion is already banned but technologies such as ultrasound have made it easier to know a baby 's gender in advance , increasing the chances for aborting girls .


Despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recent years that allows rural families to have two children if the first is a girl , China has shown no sign of abandoning the one - child policy and cracks down on those who advocate against it .

Shiites openly mark Mohammed 's birthday in Iraq as lawlessness still reigns = ( PICTURES ) =


BAGHDAD , May 19 ( AFP )


Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time in decades Prophet Mohammed 's birthday , as continuing anarchy and chaos threatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war-ravaged country .
1,1 per|3,3 gpe| phys

Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqi government were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromise could be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctions on Iraq .

Thousands of Iraq 's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam 's founder Prophet Mohammed .

Shiites , who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims , were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam Hussein 's Sunni - dominated regime .
24,25 per|30,30 org| org-aff

The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam , calling for good government . "

No to injustice , " " No to occupation , " " No to Israel , " " Yes to Islam , " chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform .


Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi , who last week threatened violence against " sinful " women , alcohol vendors and cinemas showing " indecent " films , offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq " the land of imams ... land of Islam . "
39,39 per|37,37 gpe| gen-aff

The demonstration came as Iraq 's top US overseer Paul Bremer began his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the country .
8,8 per|7,7 gpe| org-aff

In his frenzied first seven days , the telegenic Bremer repeatedly promised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with Saddam Hussein 's regime nearly six weeks ago .
22,23 per|25,25 org| org-aff

But despite issuing a host of tough decrees , Bremer has failed to stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country .


Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence .


In Baghdad , almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9 .
6,6 org|7,7 fac| art|7,7 fac|1,1 gpe| part-whole|15,15 per|14,14 gpe| org-aff

Only two have so far reopened , and they have no equipment whatsoever .


Baghdad 's top police job remains vacant .


And a trip to Baghdad 's looter market only bears witness to the fact that criminals are ruling the roost in the post - Saddam era .


Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of theft that followed the collapse of Saddam 's regime , the traders deal in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons .
19,19 per|21,21 org| org-aff

Jalal Jamil , a 45-year-old jewellery store owner , said the situation just keeps getting worse . "
7,7 per|6,6 org| art

The Americans encourage people to steal because when looting happens right under their noses they do nothing , " he said .


Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier US timeline on forming a government in Iraq , but US - led coalition officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track . "
25,25 per|24,24 org| org-aff

We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that precipitously , " said a source at the Organisation of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance ( ORHA ) , which is administering post-war Iraq .
25,25 per|28,33 org| org-aff

Officials from Iraqi groups that met with Bremer last week have said that he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to give them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few weeks . "
3,3 org|2,2 gpe| gen-aff|0,0 per|3,3 org| org-aff

We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but we told them : ' You wo n't be directly elected , you wo n't have any direct experience of government , " the source said . " '


Of course you will have input into the government but , since you are not directly elected , it would be a nonsense for you to have direct executive power , ' the source said . "


The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointed oligarchs in power , " the source said .


The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for internationally-supervised elections in Iraq .


Adnan Pachachi , a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on May 6 after 33 years in exile , told the independent Az-Zaman daily that elections should be held under international supervision .
7,7 per|10,10 gpe| phys

An interim government should create an election code and laws to clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly , that would draw up a constitution , Pachachi said .


A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government , the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily .


On the diplomatic front , a top Russian official said Monday that the UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US - British draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year . "
14,15 org|13,13 org| part-whole|8,8 per|7,7 gpe| org-aff

An updated text of the document may already be published today and may be put to a vote this week , " Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov told ITAR-TASS news agency .


Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution , which diplomats have been revising since the United States , Britain and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago .


Russia " will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be , " he said .


With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq , Russia has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the resolution .


Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in recovering looted ancient artefacts .

the coroner examining the remains of two bodies recovered near san francisco bay yesterday was unable to determine the cause of death .

paul ?


reporter : well , lou , one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one , an adult female , and two , the remains of the almost full-term baby boy .


and of course , this is significant because laci peterson , when she disappeared from her modesto home , was 7 1/2 months pregnant .
15,15 per|17,17 fac| art|17,17 fac|16,16 gpe| part-whole

now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone , and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case .
23,23 per|27,28 loc| phys

this person came across the bone at the shore .
1,1 per|8,8 loc| phys

he brought it home and contacted the authorities , and we took possession of it .


and you 're trying to connect it to the other --


well , we 're trying to find out if it 's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others .


reporter : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact .


now this case is also taking on a rather , we should say , almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they 're going to bring in an expert on what 's called alufating decay , and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body .


this is in the damage aspect of it .


and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full-term baby boy were inside the female 's remains at the time of death .
13,13 per|17,17 loc| phys

also , the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons , for example , if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting .


we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes .


that 's because modesto police have scheduled a news conference and while they may not say much at all they could also drop some major bomb shells , lou .

paul , let me ask you , if i may , quickly , are we expecting -- is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon ?


reporter : it sounds like all of this will be too quick , and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records .


that 's particularly important for the adult female remains .


so now they 're going to have to turn to dna , and that 's why they 're calling in these experts .


some dna testing can be very quick , but sometimes it can take up to weeks , even more , lou .


okay .


paul vercammen , thank you very much .

WalMart : Conglomerating ?


Byrne


2004-12-12T14 :47:00


Conglomerates are a fascinating species : The standard definition is ' a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses ' but the more accurate definition would be ' a company that relies on financial pyrotechnics , balance sheet juggling , and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth ' .


I love to write about them , but I 'd hate to own one , since most of their market value comes from the market 's assumption that the company 's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively justify their overvaluation .
31,31 per|29,29 org| org-aff|8,8 per|13,13 org| org-aff

Usually , it does n't work , but when it does the results can be spectacularly entertaining .


For a while ( see Ling-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details ) .


The recent rumors about WalMart 's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route .
12,12 org|4,4 org| part-whole

They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate : A gigantic main business with slowing growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business , a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock ( thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification ) , and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale .
39,39 per|42,42 org| org-aff

I can understand the concerns , but I do n't see the motivation .


As a retailer of just about everything , WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs .


After all , adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products .


They 're coming close to Smithfield Food 's very successful ' squeal to meal ' policy ; if these rumors are true , the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one .

In a recent blog post Michelle Malkin mentions the " abortion jewelry " marketed by the lovely feminist of " Unf * cked P * ssy , " Joanna Rytel .


Not that I was surprised - considering not long ago we were introduced to a people who proudly donned the " I had an abortion " slogan with great pride on their t-shirts .


The first trackback entry is from the typical anti- Christian variety :


Ms .


Rytel is absolutely correct , the anti-abortion Christians have managed to convice ( sic ) nearly everyone that abortion is wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it .


Like we have n't heard this rant before .


Yes , only the Christians value life when it 's a life before birth .


Of course it would be wrong to make people feel " horribly guilty " over abortion , but celebrating the skull-cracking procedure " for the sake of the child " in the form of t-shirts and jewelry is to be admired .


The problem for the pro-abortion movement is that hardly anyone is taking a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing .


Even by calling the movement " pro-choice " instead of " pro-abortion , " it gives credence to the Christian loonies .

Our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise Russian - Chinese relations to a new level , " he added .

Russia has given a high priority to its relations with the United States despite a bitter disagreement over the US - led campaign to topple Saddam Hussein in Iraq .

But China remains a key Russian ally , demonstrated by the fact that Hu will be the only foreign leader apart from US President George W. Bush to hold a summit with Putin in the days surrounding the Saint Petersburg festivities .

Leaders of the two Asian giants , according to UFG financial brokerage , may ink a deal for the construction of a 2,400 kilometre ( 1,500-mile ) oil pipeline from eastern Siberia to the Chinese city of Daqing , bringing Russian crude to energy-hungry China .

Although the Russian government is formally committed to building an extension of the pipeline that would supply Japan through the Russian port of Nakhodka , experts believe that project is unlikely to see the light of day .

Russian oil giant Yukos , whose output will be shipped through the pipeline , had lobbied furiously for the Chinese route although the state pipeline monopoly Transneft argued that it was wrong to tie strategic Russian energy resources to the whims of a single buyer . "

Single customers are always a danger .


However , the project makes economic sense , " commented Asia expert Dmitry Trenin , deputy director in Moscow of the Carnegie Center , a Washington - based think tank .
29,29 org|25,25 gpe| gen-aff|16,16 per|21,22 org| org-aff

The shorter Chinese route , a 2,400-kilometre project , would cost around half the Japanese pipeline , at 2.5 billion dollars ( 2.15 billion euros ) , and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic .


China , whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for Russia , especially in its backward far eastern regions , is also a major purchaser of Russian weapons . "
32,32 gpe|33,33 wea| art

It 's a very important relationship .


China is a very dynamic neighbour and a rising world power .


In many ways it is far ahead of Russia , " Trenin said .


The Chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade could be raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20 billion dollars .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

Analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in Iraq . "


The Chinese are trying to establish a rapport ( between Hu and Putin ) and this is in Russia 's interests .


However , this rapport should not serve the role of forming an alliance to counter American dominance in the world , " said Trenin . "


A lot can be said for an amicable , neighbourly relationship between Moscow and Beijing and this is what the rapport should serve , " he added .

E.g. , Mischie , who talks like an idiot , got a PhD in history .


His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper 's subject lived .
12,12 per|15,15 fac| art

Maybe he tried to invest in his paper , maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs , but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader .


Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities , which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania .
9,9 per|8,8 org| org-aff|4,4 per|17,17 org| org-aff

Local leaders did their jobs , but national leaders , pressuring TV stations to lie , associating with old communist ex - president Ion Iliescu , failed to win in big cities .


PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader .
18,18 per|0,0 org| org-aff

It is known that communist leaders die in office ( as judges of the U.S . Supreme Court ) and Ion Iliescu wo n't be different .
11,11 per|17,17 org| org-aff|17,17 org|14,14 gpe| part-whole

All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party , that 's the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet .
23,23 org|22,22 gpe| gen-aff

Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders , because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area .
19,19 per|20,20 loc| gen-aff

But Mischie was wrong , because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland , where you ca n't go if you earn 20K $ a year .
6,6 per|13,13 gpe| phys

The new power had nothing to do , but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago .


Iliescu and Nastase , ex - president and ex-prime minister , are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority .

If Mischie would n't take his chance on them , he would still be free , with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu might still pull .

James Baker , The New Village Idiot


Curt


2004-11-16T08 :33:00


Thanks to Captain Ed for bringing this up .


Apparently James Baker , former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration , has asked the Isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist to promote " peace " .
13,13 per|14,14 org| org-aff|10,10 per|14,14 org| org-aff

There is now . . . . in an Israeli prison a man named Marwan Barghouti , who is one of the young guard of Palestinians , and if the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really hard-line elements , the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas , they 're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard .

Got ta say that this shocked me , I 've always thought Mr .


Baker was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap .


Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Marwan Barghouti Marwan Barghouti ( born June 6 , 1958 ) is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) .
24,24 per|23,23 gpe| gen-aff|24,24 per|27,28 loc| gen-aff|31,31 per|34,35 org| org-aff

On June 6 , 2004 , he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians .
18,18 per|17,17 gpe| gen-aff|31,31 per|30,30 gpe| gen-aff

Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987 , leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank .
0,0 per|25,26 loc| phys|2,2 per|6,6 per| per-soc

During the uprising , he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan , where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994 .
4,4 per|8,8 gpe| phys|4,4 per|12,12 gpe| phys

In 1996 , he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council , in which he advocated peace with Israel , sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat .
3,3 per|8,10 org| org-aff|3,3 per|25,26 per| per-soc

The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank .
9,9 per|11,11 org| org-aff|11,11 org|14,15 loc| gen-aff

By the summer of 2000 , Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other , with Barghouti accusing Arafat 's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations , and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly .
6,6 per|8,8 per| per-soc

However , as the Second Intifada began , Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia .
14,14 per|17,19 org| org-aff

This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad , responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings .


Under Barghouti , the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades .


What is he thinking ?


Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace , give me a effin break

When I meet the people working alongside the United Nations -- Iraqis in fear of their life every day , because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people -- when I see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom , then I know that we are doing the right thing . . . .

11,11 per|14,14 gpe| phys

Now what should our response be as an international community ?


Our response should be to stand alongside the democrats -- the people who 've got the courage to see this thing through -- and help them see it through .


I 've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do . . . .


Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what 's happening in Iraq in the rest of the world , I just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is .

They do not know at any point in time whether they 're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation , even death , and yet they carry on doing it .

Everlast 's Rally Just Might Live up to the Name


Byrne


2004-12-20T15 :37:00


Microscopic microcap Everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment , has soared over the last several days thanks to a licensing deal with Jacques Moret allowing Moret to buy out their women 's apparel license for $ 30 million , on top of a $ 12.5 million payment now .


In other words , a competitor has decided that one segment of the company 's business is potentially worth $ 42.5 million .


Investors have prudently valued the remaining business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand , the possible new reality TV show , and most of the company 's assets -- at a negative $ 16.5 million .

The company 's stock would have to rise more than 50 % from the current level to put a zero value on that business .


And , who knows ?

Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino 's season touchdown record today with 49 against the San Diego Chargers in a thrilling game that ended in overtime .


I was happy to see Manning break the record , as last week he decided to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a touchdown .


Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of all time .


Marino 's 48 TD record was set in 1984 .

Better Late Than Ne ... Aww forget it !


John A


2005-01-10T10 :09:00


Remember how you stress every year to get those # % ^ ^ $ % # tax forms filed on time ?


Just imagine how Nortel feels .


Early on Tuesday Nortel will be filing its 2003 financial statements .


It also expects to restate 2001 and 2002 earnings .


None of this is really new information .


So the worst is behind them right ?


Maybe .


Late filing of audited financial statements and earning restatements both factor into my External Reporting organizational indicator .


As a rule , I am wary of companies that do either of these things until I am confident that they have changed their standard business practices .


It may take a couple years , and several more financial filings ( on time of course ) , before I am persuaded to take a second look at the company .


The bottom line is that I rely on SEC filings to assess companies and I do n't want to have any doubt about the veracity of the information contained in these documents .


In Nortel 's defense , they have just gone through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector .


The whole industry overbuilt and got blindsided by the tech downturn .


This could be described as a growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from the hangover .


I 've always felt that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hangover ( pause for brief college flashback ) .


This is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry .


Nortel and Lucent attempted to hide the damage ( What do you mean ?


I 'm not drunk ! )


and hope for an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean .


Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations , sell assets , and layoff employees .
20,20 per|1,1 org| org-aff

Cisco , on the other hand , was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward .


Their ability to do this and have it work ( so far ) indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their organization .


Especially when compared to its competitors , Cisco seems to be back in fighting form due to it 's ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market .


Not bad for a company with a hangover !

The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrified the Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews .

Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of Rome .


Just 28 years old at the time , he used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death .


As other Jews were being rounded up , Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone who could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a dangerous disease . "


We would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering from K Syndrome , " he said . "


We called it K after the German commander Kesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis , and they fled like rabbits . "

K Syndrome saved his cousin , Luciana Sacerdoti , who was just 10 years old . "

The day the Nazis came to the hospital , someone came to our room and said : ' You have to cough , you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing , they do n't want to catch an awful disease and they wo n't enter ' . "

we sold out in 16 days .

we put all these bands together .


it draws a huge audience .


so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously .


it 's like strength in numbers .


i hope this kind of thing can happen in america , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in europe .

Senators , welcome back to LATE EDITION .


Mr .


Chairman , let me begin with you .


Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that , when all the dust settles , the U.S .


may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ?


SEN. RICHARD LUGAR ( R ) , INDIANA


No , I concur with Secretary Powell , Secretary Rumsfeld , the president , that weapons of mass destruction are there , and likewise , that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are .
33,33 per|37,37 gpe| gen-aff

What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that is there to produce more .


Because not much else is -- you do n't need much to get it going again .


And that , I think , we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they do n't re-enter the business , much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn - Lugar program .
35,35 per|34,34 gpe| org-aff

BLITZER


What about you , Senator Dodd , do you believe , in the end , they will find weapons of mass destruction ?


SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD ( D ) , CONNECTICUT


I have no evidence to the contrary .


And certainly , they have used them in the past .
3,3 gpe|6,6 wea| art

There 's no doubt about that at all , both in Iran and against the Kurdish population .


So , whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country .


It would n't surprise me to hear that .


But I 'm going to work on the assumption , based on the intelligence that has been gathered , that the weapons of mass destruction existed .


BLITZER


What if they do n't ?


DODD


Well , you know , they 've used it in the past , and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they 've used them in the past .
5,5 gpe|8,8 wea| art|38,38 gpe|41,41 wea| art

So , I would n't dwell on that point specifically , because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons .
20,20 per|25,25 wea| art

He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity , and the world is a safer place today because he 's not ruling Iraq .


BLITZER


Will the U.S .


lose creditability , Mr .


Chairman , if , if the U.S .


finds no hard evidence , no so-called smoking gun ?


LUGAR


No , we have full credibility in Iraq .


We 've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people , and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction , or at least to suppress evidence of them .


That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that 's important .


It 's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and , likewise , the people involved , because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail .


BLITZER


Senator Dodd , how important is it for the U.S .


to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein ?


DODD


Well , it 's important .


But I do n't think it 's as important as finding Osama bin Laden , for the simple reason that I do n't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat , wherever he is .


If he is alive , obviously , he does n't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism .
22,22 per|24,24 org| org-aff|24,24 org|27,27 loc| gen-aff

So , it would certainly be good to know where he is .


It would be , certainly , to know , to apprehend him , to bring him before a court of justice .


But I do n't think it 's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him .


BLITZER


And you agree with that assessment , Mr .


Chairman ?


LUGAR


Yes , I think that Senator Dodd is right on .

i understand you were on board when this rescue happened .


were you in charge ?


yes , that 's correct i was in charge .


tell us about what happened here .


what was it you were looking at when you looked out over the waters ?


well , it was quite windy , gusty winds up to 40 , 50 miles an hour .


and it came from southeast .


and we got the alarm this distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning .


and we were on relatively slow speed for the time being , but we of course , speeded up to the position , which was given , and we -- after an hour , we spotted the fishing boat in the waters .


these men were in some water that was quite frigid .


if they stayed out there for long they could have suffered severe tragedy , perhaps .


i want to ask you , have you ever done anything like this ?


have you ever seen anything like this done ?


no , i have never seen this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear , more or less .


and that the survivors , they had to go into the water , pick them up from the water .


was there any point at which you did n't think you would be able to pull it off ?


sorry , please say again ?


was there any point at which you thought you would n't be able to pull it off ?


no , absolutely not .


we -- we were 100 % sure we could make it , absolutely .


because we came very close to the vessel .


we had our rescue boat out soon .

so i felt confident about it .


i saw the fishermen also had the surviving suits on .


so that gave me more time to help .


that was a good thing for them .


what about your crew that was actually involved in the rescue here ?


are they trained for this sort of thing ?


yes , they are very much well-trained .


we train for this type of operation at least every 14 days .


i 'm hopeful those three fishermen bought you a glass of wine once you got them on board .


we gave them some .


these incredible pictures .


i 'm not sure if you have been able to see some of these pictures playing on the television sets around the world but we look at these pictures and think there 's no way a cruise ship , as big as it is , will be able to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas to save three corks out there on the water .


amazing .

Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-month Palestinian uprising as Israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory , a Palestinian security source said .

The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US - backed Middle East " roadmap " , which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians .


Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday , police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya , he said .

In another first in the almost three-year intifada , the Israeli army allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans - Gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory .

The three military checkpoints on the highway , which runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip , had transformed the trip from north to south , ordinarily a 30-minute ride , into a grinding two or three-hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation . "

Video Rentals : The Three Hypotheses


Byrne


2004-12-11T18 :45:00


Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year , when it became one of the hottest stocks around ( sporting an eye-popping P/E in the high 900 's on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1,000 on the way down ) .


There 's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental , and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypotheses :


I .


That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view , video-on-demand , pirated movies , high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals .


Those who do n't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits .


Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films ; they 're the stodgy , expensive way .


There are n't any pure-play buys on this theory , but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all .
12,12 per|21,21 org| org-aff

Of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show , and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by Yahoo !


, to Yahoo !


's great regret .


II .


Not so fast -- it 'll just go online !


-- Anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997 , when in terms of time used , text was the most popular kind of information online .


At the time , and for years after , people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete .


After all , how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like ' books ' or ' newspapers ' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation , too ?


As it turns out , of course , Amazon.com , BarnseandNoble.com , and a host of others simply took the bookstore model , attached a 56K modem , and declared themselves The Future .


Netflix is doing much the same thing : Taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service .


III .


Who d' you think you 're kidding ?


You ca n't kill movie rental stores -- So there 's a big difference between movies and books : For books , the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do n't sell through them , books wo n't get sold .


For movies , the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there ( though at 45-55 % of studio revenues , it 's a much more important one than people think ) .


But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there 's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two .


The latter , at least , still has room to grow .


By focusing on smaller , rural communities ( preferably the sort that considers DSL ' newfangled ' ) they 're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart 's awful in-store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices .


The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows , but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional ( read : high ) profits .


The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors , a buyout shop , and one of the savviest raiders around , is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something .


And I 'm one of them .


Full Disclosure : For once , I 'm actually writing about something I own : I have shares of Movie Gallery , I 've suggested it to friends , and I 'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up .
15,15 per|19,20 org| org-aff

I do n't do ' sell targets ' , but I 'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50 % from this level .


If I sell , I 'll post a notification one trading day beforehand .


Because Lord knows you care .

Speaking to reporters after the verdict , Anwar lambasted the judges , saying they had been `` preselected '' by the government to quash his appeal .


`` These are spineless judges , '' Anwar said .


`` This decision is all scripted . ''


The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail .


But Anwar 's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal .

On Monday , Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges , after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior .


He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy , his lawyers said .

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar , his former protege , in 1998 following disputes over financial policy .

Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested , charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges .


Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power .


The government denies this .


Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday 's verdict `` represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country . ''


`` This decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases , the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed , '' the London - based group said in a statement .

`` Today , the situation looks much bleaker . ''

The dictator Suharto has fallen , the constitution has changed , the media was unshackled , democratic elections held , and East Timor freed .

Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations .


Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule .


Both are resource-rich , but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption .


And , currently , both have opposed the U.S .

But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales .


Analysts worry that Indonesia 's military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago , allowing for easy infiltration by extremists .

`` So they want to look for alternative sources for planes , helicopters and other hardware . ''


Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a customer .

If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue , it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged .


Whatever happens , Indonesia , a mainly Muslim but politically secular state , is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy .


What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia 's economic ambitions .


Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to dlrs 203.5 million in 2001 _ the last year for which statistics are available .


Analysts say this can only grow .


The real concerns , though , are in the petroleum sector .


Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russian companies a toehold in Indonesia 's oil and gas industry , long dominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP .

So get this ...

I 'm reading ESPN this morning when I stumbled across the story where Kobe Bryant said he 'd like to sit down with Shaq and apologize to him for " involving him in my troubles . "


Bryant also says that he thinks December 25th " sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him I never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out . "


You see , after Kobe 's world fell apart because he could n't resist banging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel , he needed an out .
19,19 per|22,22 org| org-aff|21,21 per|22,22 org| art

He bought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos that said how much he loved her , but he needed to do more to attract attention away from himself .
2,2 per|3,3 per| per-soc

So he told the media that he should have done what Shaq always did , just pay the women to shut up .


Kobe also alleged that O'neal had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years .


Shaq has denied it from the beginning , but that 's not really the point .


It 's no secret that a large number of the NBA 's " stars " are not exactly star-worthy .
13,13 per|10,10 org| org-aff

Good players or not , guys like Kemp and Bryant and Iverson and the entire Blazers team are just not very nice or good people .
16,16 per|15,15 org| org-aff

If the league will tolerate it , what do I care ?


But the real issue is this .


Kobe 's Lakers will play Shaq 's Miami Heat on ... that 's right ... December 25th .
0,0 per|2,2 org| org-aff|5,5 per|7,8 org| org-aff

So the real motivation for Kobe here is not to mend fences or admit he was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of woe .


It is to find some sort of way to keep the 340-pound Shaquille and his teammates from beating the ever-loving shit out of Kobe for 48 pain-filled minutes on Christmas Day .
14,14 per|15,15 per| per-soc

I ca n't tell you the number of ways that Kobe Bryant makes me sick .


Despite his slick talk and his nice diction , he 's nothing but a cheater and a liar and a punk .


I hardly watch any NBA games because the league and most of it 's players sicken me , but I 've had December 25th circled on my calendar since the day after Shaq signed with the Heat .
32,32 per|36,36 org| org-aff|14,14 per|12,12 org| org-aff

That 's the day that Shaq will take a million dollars or more out of Kobe 's punk-ass .

The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudanese pounds ( about US$ 400 ) , lawyer Ngor Olang Ngor told The Associated Press .


Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension .


The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor , the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country , where a civil war has been waged for 20 years .

Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict .


The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council , a government - appointed body , for approval , Ngor said .


The secretary general of the National Press Council , Hashim el-Jazz , did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday .

The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law , which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity .


The charges arose from letters-to-the - editor published last month that dealt with religion .


One letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by Islam .


Earlier this week , security police detained the Monitor 's managing editor , Nhial Bol , for 24 hours .

On his release , he was charged with incitement of public discord for publishing the letters .

In a separate action against the Monitor , security officials went to its editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management that it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million Sudanese pounds ( about US$ 6,000 ) that was outstanding from a court conviction last year .

U.S. LIKELY TO WAIT , REGROUP BEFORE ATTACKING BAGHDAD

By EDWARD EPSTEIN


c. 2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE


WASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican Guard divisions that formed Baghdad 's outer defensive ring , U.S . Army and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi capital 's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of the U.S .

Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein 's regime has gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street - to - street urban fighting .

Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday .

`` We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it . ''


Instead of an all-out assault , analysts expect the United States to follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city of Basra .

If these patrols meet little opposition , thousands of troops could rush into the city .

If the Iraqis respond forcefully , the Army and Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry Division , which will soon start moving north from Kuwait .

While they wait , the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are within the city and where Hussein might be , if he is still alive .

`` The Basra model will work for a while , at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city , '' said Lawrence Korb , an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan .

The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi civilians , which makes the British experience around Basra instructive , the analysts said .

The British have been outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week .

`` The key endgame may be whether the U.S .


can parse out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city , or at least locate them well enough to at man of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report .

U.S . strategists say that Hussein , if he is still alive and in control of his forces , might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S .

His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad .

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city .

`` If U.S . forces seriously degrade Iraq 's half-dozen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle , and only have to face perhaps 30,000 Special Republican Guard , fedayeen , and related personnel , the task will not be as hard as it might have been , '' he said .

This shows the Iraqi military 's growing weakness , he said .

`` The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level , '' he said .


The Iraqis still have n't used chemical weapons , even though many experts feared such attacks as the U.S . troops neared Baghdad .
20,20 per|18,18 gpe| org-aff

Korb , who 's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to U.N . inspectors , said he would n't be surprised if Hussein tried to use them .

But he also said , `` He may destroy them to embarrass us , '' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression .


The U.S . forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army 's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are trained in urban warfare .
3,3 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff|23,23 per|18,18 org| org-aff

But in such close-quarters fighting , they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy , which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties .


However , Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide , straight boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern .


`` Our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

But there would be lots of casualties on all sides , '' Korb said .

Russia hints " peace camp " alliance with Germany and France is dying by Dmitry Zaks


MOSCOW , April 13 ( AFP )


Russian President Vladimir Putin 's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long-term " peace camp " alliance following the end of war in Iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend . "

Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates will resume normal relations , " the senior Moscow official , who was reported to be close to Putin , told the paper . "
21,21 per|20,20 gpe| org-aff|23,23 per|30,30 per| per-soc

The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the United States . "


The comments indicate that Russia 's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials .

Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve friendly relations with the United States than the pro- European , anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign and defense ministries .
30,30 org|29,29 gpe| gen-aff

Russia 's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in Soviet - era debt that Baghdad owes it , as a gesture of good will .
3,3 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff|12,12 per|11,11 gpe| org-aff

Kommersant business daily joined in , declaring in a furious front-page headline : " The United States is demanding that Russia , France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war . "


And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed : " We should have expected this !


.


.


This is only the start of a massive US campaign ( to decide Iraq 's future finances ) . "


Yet Putin has been far more reserved .


He and his loyal finance minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia - US relations . "
2,2 per|5,5 per| per-soc

On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate , " Putin said . "


Russia has no objections to such a proposal . "


Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post-war revival of Iraq .

The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the US - British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
30,30 per|29,29 gpe| org-aff

But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq .


And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti- Washington stance of Schroeder and Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush .
22,22 per|26,26 per| per-soc

Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush 's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq , to attend the pow-wow in Saint Petersburg 's Grand Hotel Europe , although diplomats said Blair turned the offer down .

It remains to be seen how successful Putin 's overtures to Washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war stance .

It seems that in recent years , instead of doing the people 's business , good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds .


She used it for various things , but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a facelift .


Here 's a link to the story :

One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat .


Ummm , am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90 's ?


You never EVER show up at court , especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money , wearing a fucking FUR COAT !!


Fake or not , you look like you 're rubbing the common man 's nose in it .


Schrenko is a scumbag and , although she wo n't get any actual jail time , I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole .

Laser Beam Question


Curt


2004-12-30T18 :44:00


This recent news story is troubling in many different ways .


When I first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas from the West to East coast .


The FBI , concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons , is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas .

Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash .

The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs , Colo .

, and one each in Cleveland , Washington , Houston , Teterboro , N.J .
11,11 gpe|13,13 gpe| part-whole

, and Medford , Ore .
2,2 gpe|4,4 gpe| part-whole

, according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials , some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity .


A federal law enforcement official , who declined to be identified by name , said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity .


But pilots are troubled by the incidents , and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons . "
19,19 per|25,25 wea| art

It 's not some kid , " said Paul Rancatore , a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association . "
21,21 per|24,26 org| org-aff

It 's too organized . "


Loren Thompson , who teaches military technology at Georgetown University , called it a " rather worrisome development , " though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed . "
3,3 per|8,9 org| org-aff

What we 're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft , " Thompson said . "


That 's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . "


Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI suspects would be " fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated . " "


It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents , " Thompson said .


Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers .


Lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree .


These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet .


To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart .


In my opinion this is quite alarming .


This Is n't Writing , It 's Typing has a great post out with a ton of info , some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese - produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight .

The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo -- which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 -- was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons .

According to The Asian Pacific Post , " Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck .

They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen , but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage . "

PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also .


I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners , which this might very well be a precursor to : Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles ( SAMs ) , referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems ( MANPADS ) , pose to commercial airliners .
39,39 per|44,44 wea| art

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat .


Instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( IR ) countermeasures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts .


Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement .


However , this option has a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat .


Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks .


However , these techniques by themselves can not completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S .


airliners flying to and from foreign airports .


Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress ( H.R. 580 , S. 311 ) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service .


While this legislation is still under consideration , Homeland Security appropriations designated $ 60 million in FY2004 and $ 61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology .


It is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program , in January 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft .

You know , for the past five days and really for about the past fifteen or twenty days , I 've been angry about the BCS rankings and why Auburn is n't ranked higher and all of that business .

I mean , here we are , 10-0 and staring down the barrell of a road game AT Tuscaloosa against our hated rivals , the Alabama Crimson Tide , and I 'm bitching about how we better get to play for a national title ?


Really ?


You do n't have to think back too far to find a similar scenario , only with the shoe firmly on the other foot .


In 1989 , Alabama was 10-0 , number two in the nation and coming into Auburn for the first time ever to play at Jordan-Hare Stadium .


All the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about " if Bama 's undefeated , they 'll play for it all in the Sugar Bowl " and other crap like that .


Well , " if or when " never happened because Auburn won 30-20 in one of the greatest Iron Bowl games ever , putting an end to Bama 's national title hopes for the year .


15 years later , the situation 's reversed .


It 's Auburn that 's undefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season .


Suddenly , I 'm about nauseous about this game too .


Despite being riddled with injuries , Alabama has a ridiculously stout defense , recently ranked as the number one defense in the country .

Egad .

I was on vacation from December 23rd until today , January 3rd .


It 's tough to come back to work after being gone for ten days , but I think it 's tougher to stay home and try to do what my wife does every day , which is work , raise our daughter , keep the house , cook , and everything else .

Thanks for everything babe .


Now , the thing I forgot to tell you was that when I walked out of the office to go home on the 23rd , there was a pink post it on my car .

Really .


Including the sad face .


I am happy she left the note and took responsibility for it , but what in the fuck is going on that every couple of months I 'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault ?


This is the third incident in 15 months , and two of the three involved other folks hitting my parked cars !!

I knew my 20 year clean record would end sometime , but do the karma Gods have to beat me over the head with a shovel about it ?


So today I had Enterprise pick me up at 7:15 , which was great .


I was worried about being late to work and , as it turned out , I was only 16 minutes late .


I was given a choice between a taurus and an impala .


I took the impala .

I actually do n't know if it will be Monday yet , as I didn ' twant to ruin Joyce 's New Year by giving her the bad news .


I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total , complete with my rental car for a week .

The Exponentials

It 's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy : The best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely astounding rate .


Usually , the improvement curve flattens pretty fast -- the usual auto industry / computer industry comparison works just fine ( According to the standard urban legend , Bill Gates notes that " If we 'd been making cars instead of software , you 'd get 500 miles to the gallon , need an oil change every 250,000 miles , and be able to replace your car for $ 200 , " to which a mythical GM executive replies " Ah , but if Microsoft made cars , they 'd crash three times a day , too ! " )

.


Anyway , a few announcements during the last two days underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over : Hewlett-Packard is developing a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of information .


No idea where this will end up : It 's not altogether rare that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop something that , for whatever reason , is n't worthwhile to consumers .


But it 's important to remember that the status quo is never more than a snapshot -- investing as though it 's permanent is a recipe for disaster .
