Economic Development Accountability ?


Will Vehrs


2005-01-27T10 :17:00


The Augusta Free Press ( motto : " Our only agenda is the truth " ) has a Chris Graham story on a Del .


Chap Peterson , D - Fairfax , bill that would require payback by companies lured to Virginia by incentives if they do not stay for five years .


The text of HB2898 is here .


Peterson , of course , is a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination .


Graham 's article has the interesting hook of quoting one of Peterson 's rivals , former Congresswoman and State Sen .
19,19 per|18,18 gpe| org-aff

Leslie Byrne , as approving of the measure because it 's " something that I 've been talking about for some time now . "


The Virginia Economic Developers Association has not taken a stance on the bill , but the organization 's leadership is expected to meet tomorrow to discuss it .
18,18 per|16,16 org| org-aff

Demanding accountability from economic development is a rare phenomenon .


I would expect them to oppose it .


If anybody would like to debate the merits of this proposal or discuss economic development in general , the comment section is open .


PS One of our Bacons Rebellion contributors , Steven Sisson , offers this testimonial : " Without a doubt , The Augusta Free Press is the best thing since sliced bread ! "


Hey , what 's this blog , chopped liver ?

If I recall correctly , the last time that Virginia seriously addressed the " incentives " issue was during the Allen administration .


The idea then was to peg incentives to performance : If the touted jobs and investment do n't materialize , you lose the tax breaks and incentives .


By demanding accountability , Peterson 's bill is in the spirit of Virginia 's existing policy , thought perhaps somewhat tougher .

I 'm not a certifiable Blogophile yet .


In my estimation , the Bacon 's Rebellion blog is nothing more than " Bacon Bits " but do n't blog me wrong , because I love bacon bits on salads .


The same might be said of Chap 's condiment-packaged business bill .


Delegate Chap Petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepper electioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and is probably tied into the Democratic outsourcing clamor and growing threat of more manufacturing plants closing , which John Kerry politically contrived and sensationalized for the 04 presidential run .


Residents throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and the rest of the nation are economically vulnerable due to free trade agreements and the global economy .
0,0 per|3,3 gpe| gen-aff|0,0 per|8,8 gpe| gen-aff

But both parties are responsible and have voted in favor of those agreements .


Lt. Governor candidate 's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both good politicians , but need to start thinking outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplaces for Virginians .


Will , I agree with your analysis , the VA business community along with a majority of GA members will probably deep-six this 5-year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation .
18,18 per|17,17 org| org-aff

If not bordering on the political ridorkulous ( ridiculously dorky ) , it 's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity .


Reward-to-punishment-to-reward maybe good dog training techniques , but it 's not very business friendly .


The Commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) within the contractual economic development agreements .


The ESOP is itself a corporate finance vehicle that provides monetary incentives with lending institutes , state and federal tax benefits , new capital investment , and most of all , the stock ownership plan increases VA employee capital wealth .
37,37 per|36,36 gpe| phys

More capital wealth will drive our consumer - base economy through the flipping roof .


But most importantly , how many Virginia businesses will choose to relocate -- or outsource when employee are the corporate stockowners ?


And let s say the business has no other choice but to remove to the third world ...


When Virginia 's employees are fully vested in company stock , they will also reap from the profits of lower wages in the global marketplace just like the corporate big boys .
3,3 per|1,1 gpe| phys

It 's Win-Win -- sort of .

Steve Sisson said : " Lt. Governor candidate 's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both good politicians ... "


Define what makes a " good politician ! "


If one defines being on the extreme liberal fringe of the Democart party as good , than Byrne surely qualifies under that label .


Peterson is slightly to the right of Byrne , but not by much ...


Frankly , I do n't consider tax and spend liberals as good politicians .


Unfortunately , the Republican Party is also loaded with its share of irresponsible big spenders , but hopefully some of them will be held accountable during the 2005 primary elections .

On the other hand , I have yet to see any Democrats challenge incumbents for being fiscally irresponsible .

It 's a great summary of the paradoxes of the Russian economy : They have a huge untapped supply of valuable IT labor , but their IT exports are only a tenth of their military exports ( and only a thirtieth of India 's IT exports ) .


They develop lots of new technology , but nobody can tell who owns what .


And , of course , their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than China 's -- after the Putin administration mugged Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone , they lost a lot of trust .


Still , they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential .

Anyway , enough nostalgia from me , at least for now .


The wife and I were watching SportsCenter this morning , and Lee Corso , Mark May and Trev Alberts were ALL picking Auburn to beat Georgia , and the last two were picking them to run the table for the right to play USC for the national championship .
3,3 per|1,1 per| per-soc

Blurble ....


Then , I open the Atlanta paper this morning , and EVERYTHING is pro- UGA .


I mean , I knew it would be , but some of it was even based on facts .


Like this beauty : When Auburn and their opponent are both in the top ten , Auburn is 4-6-1 in those games .


Auburn has lost the last three games that fit that scenario .


Blurble ....


Auburn 's last defeat came at the hands of ... UGA .


Blurble ...


Auburn does lead the overall record in the series 51-46-8 .


However , the road team 's record in this series .


AT Auburn , UGA is 11-8-2 .


At Athens , Auburn is 17-8 .


This trend was serious in the 80 's , with the road team winning about two-thirds of the time .


The only time this changed recently really was when UGA decided to win in their place in 2003 .


Thanks Dawgs .

On the upside , Auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last six games .


That 's a pretty nice run .


Auburn leads the SEC in scoring offense , scoring defense and rushing defense .

Auburn 's Quentin Groves and Georgia 's David Pollack are tied for the SEC sack lead .
2,3 per|0,0 org| org-aff|7,8 per|5,5 org| org-aff

Here 's the biggest for what it 's worth stat as far as I am concerned : both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first .


Auburn is 8-0 and UGA is 5-0 .


I 'd say that 's the biggest stat right now .


Auburn 's offense is potent and efficient .


UGA 's defense is relentless and contains a couple of the country 's biggest hitters , especially Greg Blue and Odell Thurman .
14,14 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff

Auburn 's defense is fast and relentless and the DB 's are experienced and big .


UGA 's receivers are leaders , with one of them a team captain .
2,2 per|0,0 org| org-aff

Auburn 's two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous , bruising backs .
4,4 per|0,0 org| org-aff

UGA 's two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience , but are dangerous as well .
3,3 per|0,0 org| org-aff

In my mind , the game is going to turn on a few key points , some obvious and some not .


Here goes the prediction machine :


- Turnovers ( as always ) will be critical .


- Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position .


- Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful .


If Auburn goes for 150 between their two backs , they 're almost impossible to beat .
8,8 per|6,6 org| org-aff

Conversely , Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of David Greene .


- Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that Tommy Tuberville .


Tubs is famous for taking chances , often unnecessary ones .


That history is of concern to me .


While it 's okay to try crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog , it 's important not to give games away when you 're the favorite .


Playing more " by the book " and a bit " closer to the vest " becomes the call for the day .


Considering all of these factors , I truly believe that this is Auburn 's year .


They may not go undefeated and they may not get into the BCS title game , but they have enough talent , poise and experience to win this game .


Auburn wins 31-21 .


And now that I have typed that prediction , I may just throw up in my mouth .

[ applause ] d the extra $ 400 per child to american families this year , 2003 .
12,12 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff

all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans .


and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan .


a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income taxes .
1,1 per|3,3 per| per-soc

instead of paying $ 1,178 per year , the family would pay $ 45 a year .


[ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year .


that money can cover a lot of bills .


that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying .


that money will be in circulation , which will be good for our economy .


[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector .


the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves .


it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates .


most small businesses are sole proprietorships , limited partnerships , are subchapter ss , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates , you benefit small business formation .


as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut .
15,15 per|14,14 org| org-aff

which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .


a growing economy also needs small business investment .


and our tax code should encourage investment .


today a small business can deduct a maximum of $ 25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment .


we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment .


[ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $ 75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation .


by doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery .


and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company 's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available .


more investment equals jobs .


and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job .


[ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends .


[ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair .


it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .


the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends .


falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income .

MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud : report


WASHINGTON , May 19 ( AFP )


MCI , formerly WorldCom , and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant 's 11-billion-dollar ( 9.4-billion-euro ) fraud case , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday .


Under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case , MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the Journal said , citing sources close to the matter .


The report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be " exponentially larger " than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year .


Last month , the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors .
15,15 org|13,14 loc| gen-aff

MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI , formerly known as WorldCom , agreed not to mislead investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the Journal said .


The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said .


Separately , former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400-million-dollar loan from MCI , the Journal said , citing SEC documents .
4,4 per|3,3 org| org-aff

Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assets owned by Ebbers , to secure the loan .


The company has already sold his Georgia - based yacht building business for 15 million dollars , and is close to selling his ranch in British Colombia , which is expected to bring 60 to 70 million dollars , the Journal said .

HONG KONG ( AP )


The Hong Kong Jockey Club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring Macau , a newspaper reported Tuesday .

The South China Morning Post quoted Hong Kong Jockey Club Chief Executive Lawrence Wong as saying the discussions were underway , but no price was reported .

The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kong races in Macau , at a better price for gamblers because less tax would be levied , but the plan never materialized .

Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated Press to inquire about the buyout talks .

Choicepoint 's biggest screwup


Byrne

We all know by now that Choicepoint allowed some highly respectable Nigerian businessmen of impeccable credentials to view hundreds of thousands of customer records for entirely legitimate purposes -- they were paying customers , after all , and The Customer is Always Right .
12,12 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff

But even after that huge mistake -- or rather , because of it -- the company 's top executives began dumping shares like mad .
18,18 per|15,15 org| org-aff

What 's scary is that since they started selling , the stock 's down about 5 % .


Clearly , they were expecting lots more damage .


These insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal ( though the legal proof may be hard to come by ) but the solution is easy enough : They need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they 'll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back ( since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders ) , and there 's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .
29,29 per|36,36 org| org-aff|60,60 per|36,36 org| org-aff

Or , if you want to do things the SEC 's way , you could 1 ) Hire a bunch of lawyers with the company 's ( shareholders ' ) money , 2 ) Hire a legion of PR firms to explain away that frivolous spending , 3 ) Hire a new accountant to magically turn that spending into an investment amortizable over twenty years , and 4 ) Settle out-of - court by having the execs give the SEC some pittance ( for which they 'll likely be compensated by the company ) and a statement that " We neither admit nor deny that we did what you claim , but we 'll never do it again . "


Thank God for the SEC -- they 've practically made it a shareholder 's utopia , here .

Roundup : UK , US downplay divide on UN role in post-war Iraq


BELFAST , Britain , April 8 ( Xinhua )
0,0 gpe|2,2 gpe| part-whole

A two-day summit between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush ended here Tuesday with both countries trying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after the ongoing US - led war against the country is over .
7,8 per|16,16 gpe| phys|6,6 per|4,4 gpe| org-aff|11,11 per|10,10 gpe| org-aff

As the US - led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad and the second Iraqi city of Basra , Blair and Bush agreed there would be a " vital role " for the United Nations in post-war Iraq .
6,6 per|16,16 gpe| phys|6,6 per|5,5 gpe| org-aff|6,6 per|11,11 gpe| phys|16,16 gpe|15,15 gpe| part-whole

During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David , Blair and Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq , when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 's suggestion of a strong UN role .
12,12 per|9,10 fac| phys|14,14 per|9,10 fac| phys

After the Camp David talks , Blair , who analysts say has been pursuing a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain 's traditional role as a transatlantic " bridge " , was forced to readjust his tone .


Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq , some analysts said even before this summit at Hillsborough , south of Belfast , the second of its kind since the war broke out on March 20 .
31,31 gpe|35,35 gpe| phys

In a joint written statement , the two allies pledged to seek UN Security Council resolutions to affirm Iraq 's territorial integrity , ensure aid delivery and endorse an " appropriate " post - conflict administration for Iraq . "
13,14 org|12,12 org| part-whole

We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary - General of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representatives , " the statement added .
8,10 per|6,7 org| org-aff|21,21 per|23,23 gpe| gen-aff|26,26 per|25,25 gpe| org-aff

The United Nations would have a " vital role " in the effort to repair Iraq 's infrastructure , Blair told reporters at a news conference after his talks with Bush , downplaying UN role in emphasizing that ultimately the country must be run by the Iraqi people . "
47,47 per|46,46 gpe| gen-aff

The key is that Iraq in the end should be governed by the Iraqi people , " Blair said , pledging that British and US forces would not stay in the country " a day longer than necessary " .
25,25 per|24,24 gpe| org-aff|14,14 per|13,13 gpe| gen-aff|25,25 per|22,22 gpe| org-aff

It was a " false choice " to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition forces or the United Nations , said Blair , who was believed to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush .
16,16 per|15,15 gpe| org-aff

Echoing Blair , Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects of post-war Iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , adding that Iraq would " move as quickly as possible " to an interim authority made up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country .
45,45 per|41,41 org| org-aff

However , when pressed on what precisely the UN role would be , Bush on Tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work , " suggesting " people to staff the interim authority and helping Iraq " progress . " "
24,24 per|29,29 org| org-aff

When we say vital role for the United Nations , we mean vital role for the United Nations in all aspects of the issue , whether it be humanitarian aid , or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority .


The Iraqi people will decide who 's on the Iraqi interim authority , " said Bush .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| gen-aff|5,5 per|11,11 org| org-aff

Bush did not spell out how much power the United Nations would have , nor did he elaborate on Washington 's plans to place US officials alongside Iraqis in the interim administration .
25,25 per|31,31 org| org-aff|27,27 per|31,31 org| org-aff|25,25 per|24,24 gpe| org-aff

Differences still remain between the United States and Britain , analysts said , over the speed with which Iraq should be handed to an interim Iraqi administration , and the extent to which a US - led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country .
26,26 org|25,25 gpe| part-whole

Yet , analysts argued , both Britain and the United States hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations such as France , Germany and Russia . "


We will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " Bush vowed at the joint news conference with Blair , adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the Iraqi people . "
20,20 per|17,17 org| org-aff|57,57 per|56,56 gpe| gen-aff

Rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community .


We are committed to working with international institutions , including the United Nations , which will have a vital role to play in this task , " Bush added .


Blair also pleaded the world to avoid " endless diplomatic wrangles " over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war .


France and Germany , which were most vocal in opposing this US - led war against Iraq , have been insisting that the United Nations should play a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq .


On the unresolved dispute between Europe and the United States , analysts say , Blair might again have to make a difficult choice , but he is very likely to support the United States , which Britain can not afford to fall out with .

Famed combat photographer Robert Capa , who took a classic photo of a fighter 's death during the Spanish Civil War , himself died from a land mine in Indochina .


Sean Flynn , son of the famous actor Errol Flynn , disappeared in Cambodia in 1970 .


More than 65 journalists of many nationalities died in Southeast Asia .


ABC News producer David Kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the Balkans in 1992 .


Sometimes reporters , like " The Wall Street Journal " 's Danny Pearl , die in covering a different kind of war .


Pearl was murdered by terrorists in Pakistan .


The casualty count helps put the ongoing debate about journalistic neutrality into a sharper light .


The 600 journalists embedded with American troops in Iraq will be threatened by the same fire as the troops they are covering .


Their safety , their lives , may depend on those troops .


Neutrality in a firefight ?


Not likely .


And that raises a bigger question .


Are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the war ?


In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine , CBS News President Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion -- quote -- " It 's one of the stupidest things I 've ever heard .


This story is going to be told from a U.S .


point of view .


We are American reporters , the ones with the troops . "


( on camera ) : Now , none of this means journalists will ignore unsettling news : military setbacks , lack of supplies , the infliction of civilian casualties .


Reporters who ignore or distort facts are betraying their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people running a war .


But whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or South Africa or Iraq , respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side .

South Korea 's ruling party faces call for dissolution


SEOUL , April 29 ( AFP )


South Korea 's ruling party is facing an internal reformist call for dissolving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at last week 's by-elections , party officials said Tuesday .
4,4 org|0,1 gpe| gen-aff|30,30 per|29,29 org| org-aff

The ruling Millennium Democratic Party ( MDP ) , founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung , has suffered declining popularity since President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February .
13,14 per|2,4 org| org-aff

A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers , mostly Roh 's confidants , demanded late Wednesday that the party be " constructively dissolved " to create a new grouping , MDP officials said .
31,31 per|30,30 org| org-aff|6,6 per|5,5 org| org-aff|9,9 per|11,11 per| per-soc

But the established MDP leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul , they added .


Reformist MDP members , however , vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make " tangible progress " in the process of forging a new party .
2,2 per|1,1 org| org-aff

The internal dispute erupted after the MDP lost three parliamentary seats in Thursday 's by-elections .


The opposition Grand National Party ( GNP ) took two of the National Assembly seats while a splinter reformist party got the third .


With the latest wins , the GNP increased its majority in the 272-seat National Assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the MDP .


General elections are due in April next year .

Interview With Ralph Nader , Donald Palmisano ; Interview With


Congressmen J.D. Hayworth , Bernie Sanders


BEGALA


Welcome back to CROSSFIRE .


President Bush today renewed his call for a $ 250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages from the victims of medical malpractice .


Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan , the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month .


Is her family 's pain and suffering only worth $ 250,000 ?
1,1 per|2,2 per| per-soc

Here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Dr .


Donald Palmisano , the president - elect of the American Medical Association .
4,4 per|9,11 org| org-aff

( CROSSTALK )


NOVAK


Ralph Nader , there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they ca n't afford the medical malpractice rates .
18,18 per|5,5 gpe| phys

We 'll just run a scroll of some of the states .


They 're big states .


Florida , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Texas .


This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America , is n't it ?


RALPH NADER , CONSUMER ADVOCATE


Another one of your leading questions .


This is a medical malpractice crisis .


Over 80,000 Americans , 220 every day die from medical negligence , hundred of thousands are injured .


And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income , its interest income , the stock market collapse down .


And so they 're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons .


But if you take the entire amount of premiums , Bob , that 's paid by doctors in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly , they 'd be paying less than $ 9,000 each .
16,16 per|19,19 gpe| gen-aff

That 's one-third of what they pay a receptionist .
5,5 per|8,8 per| per-soc

NOVAK


That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they ca n't afford it .


You know , Ralph , you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics .


Can you say that the lawyers , the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this , do you believe that this is healthy ...


NADER


Well , as much as they 've poured into those coffers , it 's much less than what the doctors , the malpractice insurers , the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress ' coffers .
39,39 per|41,41 org| org-aff

This is first and foremost , Bob , a question of equity .


Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that 's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that was n't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest , or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina .
33,33 per|36,36 loc| gen-aff|48,48 per|50,51 gpe| gen-aff

Are we going to say to these and so many others , you ca n't have your full day in court ?


The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level ?
7,7 per|12,13 gpe| gen-aff|9,9 per|12,13 gpe| gen-aff

I have n't yet met one senator or representative who 's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent , unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases .
19,19 per|23,23 gpe| phys|26,26 per|30,30 gpe| phys|21,21 per|23,23 gpe| gen-aff|28,28 per|30,30 gpe| gen-aff

And I 've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $ 250,000 a week , every week without any pain and suffering , no one is saying cap those .

DR. DONALD PALMISANO , PRESIDENT-ELECT , AMA


Thank you .


Pleasure to be here .

There was a hear on Capitol Hill today .


And , I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses , John McCormick testified today .


He 's the father of a little girl , 13-month-old girl , who he said today died because of medical malpractice .
3,3 per|7,7 per| per-soc

He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood .


Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages .


She died awaiting surgery .


Listen to what Mr .


McCormick said and I 'll ask you to respond .

Is n't he right ?


Is n't our president wrong to be -- did he win the Lottery ?

You know , Mr .


Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery .


Does that look like a Lottery winner to you , holding a picture of his dead baby ?
14,14 per|16,16 per| per-soc

PALMISANO


Well , the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they ca n't get access to care .


The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system .


That 's why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation .
3,3 org|6,9 org| org-aff

The current system does n't measure negligence .


It measures disability .


And what we 're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing , trauma centers are closing , pregnant women ca n't find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state .
32,32 per|41,41 gpe| phys

Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community .
8,8 per|9,9 per| per-soc|15,15 per|19,19 gpe| phys

The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage .


BEGALA


Those are important points , I do n't doubt .


PALMISANO


Yes .


BEGALA


But I wonder if you can respond to Mr .


McCormick 's point .


Who are you , who 's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $ 250,000 for the loss of a child ?
7,7 per|6,6 gpe| org-aff

PALMISANO


Well , what has to be done here is balance .


What we need is a system that 's fair to everyone , a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need .
22,22 per|27,27 per| per-soc

And the system in California that 's in the bill , in Congress now , HR-5 , that 's a system that has worked .


It brought stability to California and obstetricians in California will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60,000 in Los Angeles and in South Florida in Miami , they 'll pay $ 210,000 ... ( CROSSTALK )
6,6 per|8,8 gpe| gen-aff|25,25 gpe|22,23 loc| part-whole|27,27 per|25,25 gpe| gen-aff

NADER


Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels .


And in Florida , they 've been very weak on it .


And in some states , for example , there are doctors that are -- you know , there are 45 payouts in ten years and they 're not disciplined by the state medical board .
33,33 per|31,31 gpe| part-whole|10,10 per|3,3 gpe| gen-aff

I mean , you 've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the payoffs , Paul .


In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad , incompetent , indifferent , whatever .


They 're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down , is not supporting expansion to state licensing ...


( CROSSTALK )


PALMISANO


I want to respond to that .


The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today .


First of all , the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used .


It lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it 's really one claim , different insurers pay on the same physician and it 's counted as one claim .


It does n't mention whether they are obstetricians , neurosurgeons or emergency medicine .


It does n't list that .


Right now in South Florida , in South Florida , the latest poll shows that every neurosurgeon has been sued .


The average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in South Florida .


Now are these bad doctors ?


We 'll have no doctors , we 'll have no neurosurgeons , no obstetricians ...


NOVAK


We 've got to take a break .

Maybe they are bad doctors .

Now , I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks ( Warner Communications , which started as a merger between business in the three most mob - influenced industries around , comes to mind ) , but it 's a gamble and not a business strategy .

12,12 per|15,15 fac| phys|12,12 per|1,1 org| org-aff

But this is a one - person company , and at this point it 's saying the ' Martha ' brand is worth some $ 1.31 billion .


If anything , the value of the brand should decline over time , inasmuch as she 's rather , well , mortal .


And she 's been convincted of obstruction of justice .


This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government , they 'll be able to really coin some money .

The spate of bombings underscored how difficult it will be to carry out the U.S .


- backed `` road map '' plan , a three-stage prescription for ending violence immediately and setting up a Palestinian state by 2005 .


There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday 's attack at the Shaarei Amakim mall in the working class town of Afula , which has been targeted repeatedly by Palestinian militants because of its proximity to the West Bank .

The Islamic militant group Hamas carried out four bombings over the weekend .


The Afula explosion _ the 95th in 32 months of fighting _ went off at 5:14 p.m. ( 1414 gmt ) at the entrance to the mall , reportedly as shoppers were waiting in line for a security check .

Malls and other public places have significantly stepped up security since the outbreak of Israeli - Palestinian fighting in September 2000 .


The explosion killed the attacker and four shoppers , police said .


Twenty people were wounded , including several who were in serious condition .


Earlier Monday , a 19-year-old Palestinian riding a bicycle detonated a 30-kilo ( 66-pound ) bomb near a military jeep in the Gaza Strip , injuring three soldiers .

A Hamas leader , Abdel Aziz Rantisi , said Monday that `` legitimate resistance will continue as long as occupation exists on our holy land . ''

Asked whether Hamas was challenging Abbas , Rantisi said only that there was no point in trying to negotiate with Sharon , whom he called a `` terrorist . ''


Israel said there will be no letup in its campaign against those involved in violence .


Israel `` will continue to fight terror everywhere , at any time and in any way possible , '' a Cabinet statement said Sunday , after a Hamas suicide bomber killed seven Israelis on a Jerusalem bus earlier in the day .

Israel first threatened such a boycott several weeks ago , but enforced it only selectively .

This is to increase the siege around me .

_ the first Israeli - Palestinian summit in three years _ that he wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks , rather than disarm them by force .


The argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has been holding up implementation of the road map .


The plan calls for parallel steps in the first stage , including a Palestinian crackdown on militants , an Israeli troop pullback from Palestinian towns and a construction freeze in Jewish settlements .

would it make a noise and if it did , would anyone south of Boston give a shit ?
11,11 per|14,14 gpe| phys

Wednesday , Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004-2005 NHL season .


As if everyone did n't already know that was the case .


Shame on the NHL and shame on the players ' association for not getting a deal done , but I put much more of the blame on the owners as this " negotiation " came down to the wire .


I understand that the league was losing less money by not playing than it would have by having a season this year .


I also understand that when push came to shove , the players gave in and accepted a salary cap .


Okay , the sides were about 7 million per team apart , but could n't they just say " alright , let ' s split that in half and play hockey ? "


I mean Holy Christ people , two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work it out that way .


Why is this any different ?


The NHL 's primary goal was to get a salary cap approved by the players , and they finally did .


And what did the NHL do when that momentus event occurred ?


They left the negotiating table .


Gary Bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sports commissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout / strike / cluster fuck is the reef .


The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow ( the players ' association rep ) need to be fired , deported , flogged , tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program , four dogs , four beers , and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game .
17,17 per|14,16 org| org-aff|59,59 org|60,60 fac| art

Then , all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006 .


That means no team would own any player , and the owners would be free to sign whomever they 'd like using the " fiscal restraint " they all droned on and on about all year .
7,7 per|3,3 org| org-aff|11,11 per|17,17 per| per-soc

That way , they 'd only pay as much as they could afford ... right ?


Wrong .


Those douchebags would end up overspending like every professional sports owner because they ca n't control themselves .


If Mr .


Iginla or Heatley were free agents , for example , owners would bid each other out of their minds , then they 'd be left with not enough to get a competetive team .


While the business model in the NHL was certainly flawed and the owners needed help , they really needed help to protect them from themselves .


And the fact is that without that help , the owners would follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway .


The biggest issue is this , however .


Very few people give one hot shit whether the NHL plays another game ever , let alone this season or the next one .


For every crying Canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say " No hockey ?


Huh ... did n't even notice . "


And the last television network interested in carrying hockey ( ESPN ) may opt out of televising the NHL next season , meaning that all of the teams would be in HUGE trouble , because no TV = no league .


Period .


Atlanta lost the Flames 25 years ago because , despite full houses every night , it 's TV revenue that pays the freight and the Flames had no tv contract .
3,3 org|0,0 gpe| gen-aff

Imagine an entire league with no TV contract .


Hell , Major League Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one gives a shit about them .


I 'll say this for the NHL , when they screw up , they screw up huge .


Congrats guys .


You will forever be known as the generation that killed professional hockey in North America .


That 'll look GREAT on your resumes .

Europe Changing Their Tune ?


Curt


2005-01-01T22 :44:00


American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle .


It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush .
5,5 org|4,4 gpe| part-whole

Why you ask ?


But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .


From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .
15,15 per|16,17 org| org-aff

One is the death of Yasser Arafat .


No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli - Palestinian dispute .


For the last few years , Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat .


That another reason why I respect Bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .


May he rot in hell .
1,1 per|4,4 loc| phys

But since Arafat 's death , Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground : supporting Ariel Sharon 's withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and , covertly , backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader .
47,47 per|46,46 gpe| org-aff

A second reason is Europe 's growing worries about Islamic terrorism .


The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe 's 9/11 .
12,12 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff|20,20 per|19,19 per| gen-aff

Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that American conservatives , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance .
16,16 per|15,15 gpe| gen-aff|16,16 per|20,21 per| gen-aff|16,16 per|23,24 per| gen-aff

You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?


Get outta here .... Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about .
9,9 per|11,11 gpe| phys

The third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans - Atlantic alliance together for half a century .


The Russian bear is growling again .


The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB - style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin 's determination to control his " near abroad . "
23,23 per|22,22 gpe| org-aff|32,32 per|35,35 loc| phys

They should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was .
11,11 per|15,15 gpe| org-aff

Hopefully our Government is n't asleep at the wheel with this situation either .


There is a personal edge to all this .


Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor , there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan .
12,12 per|11,11 org| org-aff

Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House .
2,2 per|1,1 gpe| org-aff

His thumping re-election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .


In short , Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception , but the U.S .


itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it .


Strangely enough , this has been Tony Blair 's strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the Continent 's strategy , too .


Could n't of ended that article any better myself .


Get used to it France , we ai n't going nowhere .

Cisco 's Indication

Today 's performance said a lot about how the market viewed certain subjects ; tomorrow 's will tell us even more .


Today , Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines .


And tonight , Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales .


The market 's modestly pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging is n't seen as a major profit source yet ; tomorrow 's trading will tell us whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology businesses are back on track as well .


After hours , Cisco 's been slammed , but once they 're exposed to the rest of the trading population , the results might differ .


Michael


????

T09 :29:00


I do n't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or revenues .


Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watching TV , reading a book , or playing video games but I am not sure how bloglines really benefits .


I would guess it most benefits the search engines , hit counters , and software builders .


With the explosion in available market commentary that happened through the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs of access blogging really adds that much as much as it did to political commentary .


Maybe Seeking Alpha can become the new TSCM but I do n't think that will change the landscape as much as Howard Dean 's campaign did .

France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq , a step toward U.S. goal


UNITED NATIONS ( AP )


France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N .


sanctions targeting Iraq civilians , an important step toward the U.S .
3,3 per|2,2 gpe| gen-aff

goal of ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country 's economy .


The surprise move by France , which led opposition to the U.S .


war against Iraq , followed last week 's call by U.S . President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction .
12,12 per|10,10 gpe| org-aff

France 's U.N . ambassador , Jean-Marc de La Sabliere , made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief U.N . weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues .
4,4 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff|29,29 per|26,26 org| org-aff

The proposal would end the U.N .


ban on trade and investment in Iraq while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place .


The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait .


Under council resolutions , sanctions can not be lifted until U.N . inspectors certify that Iraq 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to deliver them .
15,15 gpe|22,22 wea| art|12,12 per|10,10 org| org-aff

Along with France , Russia , Germany and China also strongly opposed the war .


But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security Council `` must take into account the new realities on the ground . ''


Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is `` not at all opposed to the lifting of sanctions . ''
1,1 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff

But he said Russia wants U.N . inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction , as required under U.N .
7,7 per|5,5 org| org-aff

resolutions .


Asked about the French proposal , he said : `` We are ready to discuss it . ''


At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday , the council was to hear from Benon Sevan , head of the U.N .
17,17 per|20,20 org| org-aff

oil-for-food program , which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq 's 24 million people .
16,16 per|12,12 gpe| gen-aff

France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil-for-food program , which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first Gulf War .
2,4 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff

`` There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of this program , '' de La Sabliere said .


This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq .


These include not only Iraq 's disarmament and the future of sanctions but the U.N .


role in Iraq now that the fighting is over , control of Iraq 's oil revenue , and lucrative reconstruction contracts .


Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N . inspectors to have access to all sites and people in Iraq .
9,9 per|7,7 org| org-aff|17,17 per|19,19 gpe| phys|15,15 fac|19,19 gpe| part-whole

He said he told the council that he believes the world would like Iraq 's disarmament confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the country for over 10 years .


The Bush administration , which accused Blix of hindering its drive for international support for the war , has already sent its own teams to Iraq to search for illegal weapons .
23,23 per|25,25 gpe| phys|23,23 per|21,21 org| org-aff

`` At the moment , the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for disarming Iraq , '' U.S . Ambassador John Negroponte , said Tuesday when asked whether U.S . teams would work with U.N . inspectors .
35,35 per|33,33 org| org-aff|18,18 per|16,16 gpe| org-aff|29,29 per|27,27 gpe| org-aff

He said important scientists had turned themselves in , and the atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi `` to speak more freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking them the questions . ''


France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council `` find practical and pragmatic arrangements '' to coordinate and combine the work of the American teams and the work of U.N . inspectors `` so that the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified . ''
2,4 per|0,0 gpe| org-aff|35,35 per|33,33 org| org-aff|28,28 per|27,27 gpe| org-aff

He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended `` for a couple of months , '' and possibly renewed .


He also envisioned U.S . and U.N . inspectors working together .
8,8 per|6,6 org| org-aff|8,8 per|3,3 gpe| org-aff

`` And then sanctions could be lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place , '' he said .
11,11 org|10,10 gpe| part-whole

In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday , Blix said that before the war , the U.S .


and Britain appeared to have used `` shaky '' intelligence , including forged documents , in an effort to prove Iraq had banned weapons .


Blix said it was `` very , very disturbing '' that U.S .


intelligence failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buy uranium from the West African nation of Niger .

He told reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about `` yellow cake '' uranium `` was more than shaky , it was a fake . ''

Push to Baghdad Begins ; POW Safe in Army 's Care


WOODRUFF


U.S . forces moving ever closer to Baghdad , but military officials say they are not counting on capitulation .

For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S . forces , let 's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta .
11,11 per|9,9 gpe| org-aff|18,19 per|17,17 org| org-aff|18,19 per|21,21 gpe| phys

MILES O'BRIEN , CNN ANCHOR


Thank you very much , Judy .


To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones , and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard , we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang .


He 's retired with the United States Army .
0,0 per|7,7 org| org-aff|7,7 org|5,6 gpe| part-whole

He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency , among other things .
0,0 per|6,8 org| org-aff

Colonel , good to have you with us .


COL. PAT LANG ( RET , ) , U.S. ARMY


You 're welcome .


O'BRIEN


What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance ?


Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S . and coalition supply lines ?
9,9 gpe|14,14 fac| art|12,12 gpe|14,14 fac| art

Or both ?


LANG


Well , they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock , food , fuel and ammunition .


So , probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind , that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past .
38,38 per|39,39 fac| art|21,21 per|19,20 org| org-aff

Once they are satisfied they are through all that , I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad , probing hard to see how much resistance there really is .


O'BRIEN


Well , let me ask you that .


First of all , I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery .


This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad .
5,5 loc|11,11 gpe| phys|3,3 gpe|4,4 loc| part-whole

Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there .


We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles .


One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport .


Do you suppose that is a key target right now ?


LANG


Oh , I 'm sure it is .


I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you 'd want to hold .


And besides , as soon as you get control of it you 'd be able to start using it for air operations , and put a survey team in there as soon as it 's secured , and then start using it for helicopter operations , haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that .
27,27 per|29,29 fac| phys

And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad , they 'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well .


O'BRIEN


Now , as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big , wide divided highways there .
20,20 fac|21,21 gpe| part-whole

Control of these highways will be crucial wo n't it ?


LANG


Yeah , these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches .
9,9 loc|12,12 gpe| part-whole|6,6 fac|9,9 loc| part-whole

They will try to go down those things , cutting the city up into sectors as best they can , and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain .
26,26 loc|29,29 gpe| part-whole

I would think , probably , various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government .
12,12 org|13,13 fac| art

O'BRIEN


It 's a big city , about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts .


Some have said Chicago is a good analogy .


Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source , or am a wrong ?


LANG


Well , it depends on the attitude of the populous , which is not clear yet .


If the population , in fact , or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population , if they want to be liberated , then you can control them with a fairly small force .


If , in fact , a lot of people in the city do n't want to be liberated and you 're never going to know that until you try , then you 're going to need a much larger force , and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements .
8,8 per|11,11 gpe| gen-aff

O'BRIEN


Based on what you 've seen so far , what is your sense of that ?


The Shias are a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happened in 1991 .


They rose up , did n't get American support .


Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad ?


Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out ?


LANG


Yes , there is , but these folks are going to be mighty cautious .


They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq .
13,13 per|16,16 loc| gen-aff

And they do n't have any particular reason to trust us , so far .


So they 'll wait and see what happens .


It 's the other people in the city you have to worry about , who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime .
4,4 per|7,7 gpe| gen-aff

And their behavior right now is unpredictable .


O'BRIEN


Colonel Patrick Lang , retired , United states Army , thanks for your insights .

They Refuse to Reason


Scott


2004-11-01T18 :06:00


I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : Britain 's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .
13,13 per|11,11 fac| phys|2,2 per|8,8 fac| phys

Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes , such as the Dunblane massacre , were aberrations .


The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands , said Prof Mauser , a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada .
5,5 per|4,4 org| org-aff|22,22 per|26,27 org| org-aff|26,27 org|29,29 gpe| gen-aff

He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain 's streets .
6,6 per|9,11 org| part-whole|6,6 per|15,15 org| part-whole|15,15 org|14,14 gpe| part-whole|26,26 fac|24,24 gpe| part-whole

His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales , more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997 .


In the past two years , there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby , killed or injured by guns . "


I believe that factors of political correctness are at work , " he said . "


Police crackdowns , Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime . "


Prof Mauser added : " The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers ' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK , someone , who has not filled in a firearms certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth . "

Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June .


Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London , Birmingham and Manchester .


It does n't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain .


Just as long as it 's there , they feel safe .

Northshore Management Update


Byrne


2005-02-16T21 :20:00


Northshore Management , the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds , is now facing actual SEC action .


The amount in question : $ 37 million .


While it 's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before ( as high as $ 90 million ) , it 's good to see that the issue 's getting resolved .


Though , of course , there 's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they 're guilty of front-running , at the least .
36,36 per|34,34 org| org-aff

But they might have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital : Having invested all they could risk , it would only make sense to turn to other sources .


What we 'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1 ) What happened to the money once it was invested in these companies ( were they real companies , or just avenues for stolen funds ? )


and 2 ) How much of this was disclosed beforehand .

Thousands of fresh US troops headed for Iraq Thursday as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush discussed the effort to oust Saddam Hussein , which some senior US military officials warn could last months .

About 1,000 soldiers from the US Army 's 173rd Airborne Brigade parachuted into an airfield in a Kurdish - controlled area of northern Iraq , establishing a base through which to bring in more troops and tanks , Pentagon officials said .

And some 12,000 soldiers from the US Army 's 4th Infantry Division , which was supposed to have gone into northern Iraq through Turkey , began flying out of Fort Hood , Texas , Thursday to the region , a military fort spokeswoman told AFP .

The war in Iraq could last months and require considerable US military reinforcements to assure a victory , the Washington Post reported Thursday , quoting senior US military officials .

Tell me how this ends , " one senior officer asked the Post .


Most US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneck advance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure weapons are operable and troops resupplied after days of powerful sandstorms and damage inflicted by Iraqi attacks , the Post reports .

The Post also quoted Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon intelligence analysts complaining that Bush officials largely ignored their warning that Iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tactics and offer significant resistance .

Talks were to focus on how to run a post - Saddam Iraq , with Washington resisting a large United Nations role .


Blair faces an uphill battle to win Bush over to giving the UN oversight of a post - Saddam administration , as Washington officials are still angry at Germany , Russia , and especially France , over the failure to secure UN Security Council approval for military action .

We can not predict the final day of the Iraqi regime , but I can assure you -- and I assure the long-suffering people of Iraq -- there will be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime , and that day is drawing near , " he said .


At the last minute , Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the campaign was " ahead of schedule . "

Sirius Satellite -- Brilliant Plan , or Grasping at Straws ?

Mel Karmazin is pushing to add Sirius Satellite services to iPods -- an interesting idea , inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both .


The iPod 's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries , and Sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable .


On the other hand , Karmazin and Jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around , so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone .


My main suspicion is that this is Karmazin hoping to see the phrase " Mel Karmazin , CEO [ " That 's right , " Mel says to himself , " C-E-friggin - O ! " ] of Sirius Satellite Radio ... "

October 's Last Weekend


Scott


2004-11-01T11 :44:00


Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad .


The Good :


On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd 's Music Store for the third straight , and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands .
4,4 per|8,8 per| per-soc|4,4 per|16,19 fac| phys|8,8 per|16,19 fac| phys

Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show .


It 's something you can always expect from these guys , unlike so many other performers , and is why I never miss a show when they 're in town .


On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful Halloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and bathroom walls , a couple beer spills , unnecessary fights and the expected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas .


Naturally , I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time .


I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests .


The Bad :


On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland ; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year .


In addition , the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat .


Alas , too little too late was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been our starter since replacing Rix earlier in the season .
19,19 per|18,18 org| org-aff

Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I wo n't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday .


On Sunday we saw " Saw " ( review coming ) and as expected I was less than satisfied .


It was neither better nor worse than last week 's " The Grudge " but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies .


If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it 's worth it .

G 's Investing -- Greenspan and Star Wars


Byrne


2005-02-15T18 :58:00


G 's Investing argues that Alan Greenspan is a George Lucas - esque figure : In the Star Wars universe of George Lucas , he portrays a benevolent dictatorship ( or benevolent monarchy ) as being superior to a democracy , with the democracy being the system rife with bureaucracy and bloat .


With Greenspan 's unspoken position as economic czar , that 's what we have right now : a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed .


But one of the why dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracy offers a stable , peaceful transfer of power .


Will we have that at the Fed , when Greenspan leaves


Indeed .

Ca n't remember where I saw this , maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org .


Anyways , the battle lines for social security privatization are being identified as those who are for Choice and Ownership ( Bush ) , versus those who equate investing in the SP500 as playing the slot machines ( AARP , most Democrats , etc ) .


The battle is now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan .


Where will Dr .


Greenshades come down in this debate ?


What will he say on privatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system ?


I think that 'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next ...

Ooohhh ... I ca n't tell you how much I want to take sides here , but I 'm trying to keep my political opinions out of this -- I 'd really hate to alienate half my political audience in a single endorsement .


So I 'll just note that I do n't see it as quite so black-and-white , and I think some of the compromises ( like reducing taxes for parents , on the grounds that children are the assets backing Social Security ) might be useful and -- we are dealing with a win-or-lose , vote-or-not situation -- practical .

Not an ordinary earnings miss ?

eBay 's nauseating $ 19.72 decline ( a loss of 19.14 % ) has that end-of-an-era feel , like the Motorola crash described in The Money Game or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profiled in Dot.con .


There 's news , of course ( the only time there 's no news whatsoever is when the entire market tanks ) , but missing estimates by a penny and showing some ' red flags ' should n't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the market had the night before ( after hours , eBay had lost a modest 10 % or so ) .


Watching a stock drop after hours , open lower , and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who 's selling : a runup usually builds on a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bails .

[ oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium - and long-range missiles .

Previously , U.S . officials had said they were uncertain whether North Korea had received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a `` miniaturized '' nuclear warhead .

The new testing capability would suggest that the North Koreans are getting closer _ now , officials said , the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a year or less .


But officials say there is no sure way of knowing that they can until they actually test one .


Senior administration officials say that Washington has been trying to convince Asia gent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to force the country to give up its weapons .

The new intelligence is apparently being marshaled to support the administration 's argument .


According to officials who have been briefed on the U.S .


reports , conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set off at the testing site , which is near North Korea 's main nuclear complex .

North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon , though the CIA long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the late 1980s or early 1990s .

North Korea , unlike Iraq , has made no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapons .

Now , administration officials say they fear that the country is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons , some of which might be miniaturized .

`` This would give them the range they never had before , and the chance to spread their threat far beyond South Korea , '' said one senior Asian official , noting that approximately 60,000 U.S . troops are based in Japan .

`` It changes the dynamics of the problem . ''


The new intelligence estimates provided to Asian allies , however , left it unclear how quickly the North could produce the small warheads .

The worst-case estimate , officials say , is that they could do so in less than a year .

U.S . satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the North evicted international inspectors .

Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods , which can be reprocessed into weapons - grade plutonium .


In January the country began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessing equipment , which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration .

But according to U.S . officials , it now appears that North Korean engineers ran into technical problems in restarting the facilities .
5,5 per|3,3 gpe| org-aff|13,13 per|11,12 gpe| org-aff

While intelligence officials have reached no consensus , they told allies last week that in the worst case , only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been converted into plutonium .
2,2 per|1,1 org| org-aff

It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make enough plutonium for a weapon , experts say.O


`` What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after that to produce a miniaturized warhead , and put it into one of the missiles , '' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the intelligence .
23,23 wea|25,25 wea| part-whole

`` But after Iraq , who knows how good those estimates are ? ''


After the claims made about prohibited weapons in Iraq , which have not been found so far , skepticism about the quality of U.S .


intelligence is widespread .


And in the case of North Korea , as in Iraq , the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems most compelling .


So far , U.S .


intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons - grade plutonium .


This has led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be farther from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago .
9,10 gpe|17,17 wea| art

But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their normal storage area months ago , and it is unclear where they are _ or even whether the United States is sniffing for the krypton gas in the right place .


`` We do n't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been very active , '' said one senior administration official in a recent interview .
20,20 per|19,19 org| org-aff

`` But could there be a second reprocessor ?


No one knows for sure . ''


Without question , though , North Korea 's capabilities greatly outstrip anything Iraq has had in the past decade , and North Korea 's program is probably several years ahead of Iran 's .


President Bush and South Korea 's new president , Roh Moo-h is unclear whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way .

Bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem , but would not foreclose any option , including military options .


Roh has said any pre-emptive strike against the North 's nuclear facilities could prove disastrous .
