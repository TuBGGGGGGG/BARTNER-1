New Explosions in Mosul , Baghdad


WOODRUFF


That report filed just a short time ago .


Well , CNN analyst Ken Pollack who is with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution is with me now .

He is an expert on the Iraqi military and its tactics and weapons .

Ken Pollack , that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with , you and I were talking earlier today .
11,11,10,10 ORG-AFF

The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you 're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that .
24,24,23,23 ORG-AFF

KEN POLLACK , CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST POLICY , BROOKINGS INSTITUTION


Right .


I mean we 're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S . and British forces now , Judy , which is that they 're superbly trained troops .
15,15,14,14 ORG-AFF|15,15,11,11 ORG-AFF

They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they 're adapting .


They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face .


The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it , risks to the supply line , risks in terms of not clearing cities and they 're shifting .


They 're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that .


You 've seen U.S . Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines , get control over the cities and so I think that U.S . and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield .

WOODRUFF


So as an onlooker , as somebody who 's studied the Iraqi capabilities , is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with ?


POLLACK


Absolutely .


One of the things I think we 're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S . forces are .
26,26,24,24 ORG-AFF

Typically what you 've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top .
9,9,7,7 ORG-AFF

It does n't come from the ground up .


You do n't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey , we 'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work .


Tell everybody else to do the same thing .


Instead the high command has to identify a problem , come up with a solution and transmit it down .


Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we 've seen before , irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S . forces , some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops .
28,28,26,26 ORG-AFF|44,44,43,43 ORG-AFF

There 's no way around that but U.S . forces , British forces are beginning to adapt to it .
9,9,7,7 ORG-AFF|12,12,11,11 ORG-AFF

WOODRUFF


I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people .
18,18,17,17 GEN-AFF|9,9,8,8 ORG-AFF

I just interviewed a gentleman , native of Iraq , who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20 , 30 , 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders .
6,6,8,8 GEN-AFF|13,13,14,14 PER-SOC|22,22,25,25 PHYS|14,14,15,15 PHYS

They hate Saddam Hussein .


They do n't like what he 's doing but they do n't think the Americans are the answer .


POLLACK


All right .


Well , this is something that we 've been trying to get a grip on for years , exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do , they despise .


They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token , they do n't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that , I think it 's probably most important for most Iraqis is they 're deeply suspicious of the United States .


They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991 .


The U.S .


did n't finish Saddam then .


President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S .


did nothing and so they 're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind .


WOODRUFF


Which raises questions going forward .


One last thing , Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief .
13,13,12,12 ORG-AFF|24,24,27,27 PER-SOC|27,27,26,26 ORG-AFF

What 's the significance of that ?


POLLACK


Well , if it 's true and obviously we do n't know just yet but if it 's true , it is very significant because it 's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we 've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .
53,53,57,57 ART

WOODRUFF


( INAUDIBLE )


POLLACK


Exactly , in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market , if that had been a U.S . bomb or a U.S . cruise missile , that market would have been obliterated .
27,27,29,29 ART|32,32,35,35 ART

Chances are it was an Iraqi surface to air missile .

Troubled French media group Vivendi set to sell theme parks : report


LOS ANGELES , May 2 ( AFP )


Beleaguered French media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around 1.5 billion dollars , the Los Angeles Times said Friday .
3,3,1,1 GEN-AFF|15,15,12,12 PART-WHOLE|19,19,18,18 GEN-AFF

The report came as the indebted group said it was planning to sell off its US unit Vivendi Universal Entertainment and other assets , to focus on its telecoms activities and its French cable television business .
16,16,14,14 PART-WHOLE|16,16,15,15 GEN-AFF|35,35,31,31 PART-WHOLE

The Times said Vivendi Universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme parks to New York investment firm Blackstone Group as a the first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire .
9,9,12,12 ART|17,17,14,15 GEN-AFF|29,29,27,27 PART-WHOLE

Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment on Friday .
2,2,0,1 ORG-AFF|2,2,5,6 PHYS

Under the reported plans , Blackstone Group would buy Vivendi 's theme park division , including Universal Studios Hollywood , Universal Orlando in Florida and Universal 's ownership interests in parks in Spain and Japan , a source close to the negotiations told the paper .

Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando .

Vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year , including its famed Universal movie studio and television assets .

Chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at the group 's annual general meeting Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Universal Entertainment was a major goal for 2003 , and that negotiations were already under way .

However , Fourtou said he had not yet received any firm offer for its giant US music business , Universal Music Group , and had taken no final decision over its future .

The group , once a French utilities company , needs to reshape itself in order to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars .

In 2002 , the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros -- the biggest ever in France -- on sales of 28.7 billion .

U.S. lawmaker : North Korea says it will produce more nukes


SEOUL , South Korea ( AP )


North Korea has told American lawmakers it already has nuclear weapons and intends to build more , a senior U.S .
6,6,10,10 ART|6,6,15,15 ART|5,5,4,4 ORG-AFF

congressman said Monday after returning from a trip to the communist state .

`` They admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this moment , '' said Rep .

Curt Weldon , who headed a delegation of U.S . lawmakers that visited Pyongyang for three days ending Sunday .
10,10,8,8 ORG-AFF|11,11,13,13 PHYS

`` They admitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program . ''


Weldon 's comments echoed those of U.S . officials following talks in Beijing in April .
8,8,6,6 ORG-AFF|8,8,12,12 PHYS

They said that North Korea claimed during a pause in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons , but would give up the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees .

Weldon said at a news conference in Seoul that North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan repeated that claim during a dinner meeting .
0,0,7,7 PHYS|13,13,9,10 ORG-AFF

Both Kim and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told Weldon that Pyongyang planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearly finished reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so , despite pressure from the United States and its allies .
11,11,17,17 ART

`` They admitted to having just about completed the reprocessing of 8,000 rods , '' said Weldon , a Republican who is the No. 2 member of a U.S . House panel that oversees the armed forces .
25,25,31,31 ORG-AFF|31,31,30,30 PART-WHOLE|30,30,28,28 PART-WHOLE

U.S . experts say that reprocessing the rods could give North Korea several more nuclear bombs within months .
2,2,0,0 ORG-AFF|10,11,15,15 ART

During their visit to Pyongyang , Weldon 's delegation also met Choe Thae Bok , chairman of North Korea 's legislature , the Supreme People 's Assembly .
1,1,4,4 PHYS|15,15,20,20 ORG-AFF|20,20,17,18 PART-WHOLE

Although they were not traveling as envoys of U.S . President George W. Bush , they were the first American officials to visit since the nuclear standoff began in October .
20,20,19,19 ORG-AFF|10,10,8,8 ORG-AFF

They flew to Seoul on Sunday to brief South Korean officials on their Northern trip .
0,0,3,3 PHYS|10,10,8,9 ORG-AFF|12,12,13,13 PHYS

North Korea said it was developing its nuclear weapons as `` a response to what they saw happened in Iraq , with the U.S .
6,6,8,8 ART

removing Saddam Hussein from power , '' Weldon said .


A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run KCNA news agency that the visit helped both sides better understand each other and they shared the view that Washington and Pyongyang needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully .
5,5,4,4 ORG-AFF|4,4,1,2 PART-WHOLE

`` They were of the same view that it is necessary to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their stand that it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways of settling it , '' the spokesman said .


North Korea has repeatedly accused Washington of planing to invade .


Bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution , but has not ruled out a military option .


In Seoul , South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said his government has no `` clear proof '' to conclude North Korea has nuclear weapons .
19,20,23,23 ART|5,5,3,4 ORG-AFF|6,7,1,1 PHYS|9,9,10,10 ORG-AFF

`` North Korea has told important people of the United States that it has developed nukes and reprocessed spent fuel rods .
12,12,15,15 ART|6,6,9,10 GEN-AFF

But North Korea has not confirmed that to anyone else , '' Roh said .


`` Thus , we must make a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it has nuclear weapons or not , based on those words only . ''

U.S . and South Korean officials say that North Korea may be bluffing about its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions from the United States .

But U.S . Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Monday that the threat could n't be ignored .

`` Certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they ( North Korean officials ) are saying very seriously , '' he said at a news conference in Seoul .
15,15,13,14 ORG-AFF|23,23,30,30 PHYS

Weldon said his delegation `` comes away convinced '' that the nuclear standoff can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows Pyongyang 's communist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats .


Roh issued a similar message during a nationally televised news conference .


`` South Korea and the United States share a firm principle that North Korea should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue should be resolved through a peaceful manner , '' he said .


Roh spoke after meeting the U.S . lawmakers and Wolfowitz , who also arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a two-day visit to discuss North Korea .
7,7,5,5 ORG-AFF|11,11,15,15 PHYS

Wolfowitz said Saturday in Singapore that Washington hoped putting pressure on North Korea 's battered economy would resolve the nuclear standoff .

On Monday , Wolfowitz stressed that military readiness was just as important .


In meetings with South Korean officials , Wolfowitz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment , as U.S . forces have done .

He said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from the North and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on the peninsula , not heighten it .


The nuclear crisis flared last October when U.S . officials said North Korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord with Washington .

So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way , are finally tying the knot ?


The final price , $ 26.50 per share , beats all the previous bids by a huge margin -- of course , Oracle lowballed their earlier offers , and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft shareholders for a year and a half .
41,41,40,40 ORG-AFF

It 's been a pretty grueling fight ( was it worth it ?

made all the more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison was either bluffing or screwing around .


So it 's over .


I do n't have Oracle / Peoplesoft 's spat to kick around anymore .


I 'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other .


And I wo n't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle , starting his own company , and forcing Ellison to spend $ 10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back ( though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back ) .

Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes ?


Byrne


2005-02-26T14 :44:00


Good plan ; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states , inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes .


What 's notable in this debate , however , is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " While North Carolina 's excise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . "


Okay , okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that 's technically accurate .


But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalties are n't assessed on a per-pack basis , they do n't -- they 're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before .


Interestingly , the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost .


They 're basically buying future medical care throughout their lives , rather than eventually making the ( healthy ) remainder of the populace pay up .


In short : Good plan .

An Airline Passenger 's Bill of Rights ?


Byrne


2005-02-17T21 :15:00


Has the EU once again lost its mind ?


The one industry in which Europe incontrovertibly beats the US is their aviation industry , thanks mainly to the fact that their lawmakers have left the operation of the industry up to the people who own it , and left passenger 's rights in the hands of choosy passengers .
22,22,21,21 ORG-AFF

And now they 're ready to ' fix ' that with a new package of ill-advised rules completely changing the nature of airlines .


Before , a potential customer could choose between a cosy , near-certain ride from an expensive company or a hustled , uncomfortable , and absurdly cheap one from a smaller competitor .


And now ?

Push to Baghdad Begins ; POW Safe in Army 's Care

With U.S . forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad , the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war .
3,3,1,1 ORG-AFF

But , as it has from the beginning , air power remains an important part of the battle .


Let ' s check in with CNN 's Gary Tuchman at an air base near Iraq .
8,9,6,6 ORG-AFF|13,13,15,15 PART-WHOLE|8,9,13,13 PHYS

Gary you 've seen it firsthand from the first moments .


GARY TUCHMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT


Well , that 's right , Judy .


In two weeks after the air war began , there is no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis .


According to the Air Force , at any given time , there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq , flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq .


We come to you from a base near the Iraqi border .
0,0,6,6 PHYS|6,6,10,10 PART-WHOLE|10,10,9,9 PART-WHOLE

We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in Iraq .
8,8,11,11 PHYS|17,17,19,19 PART-WHOLE

It 's a base that was taken over by the coalition last week .
10,10,4,4 ART

8,8,11,11 PHYS|12,12,18,18 PHYS|17,17,18,18 ART

After he told us that , we asked him during his missions , and he 's flown about 30 in the last two weeks , we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him ?

Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting SA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground .
1,1,7,7 PHYS

So they 're still out there .


But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight , we continue to be effective .


And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50 percent .


And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it 's a very effective , coordinated effort .


( END VIDEO CLIP )


TUCHMAN


Lieutenant Colonel Webb ( ph ) is telling us he has a mission this very evening .


We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning , it will fly 1,900 sorties into Iraq .


A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties .


Before we go , one more thing we want to tell you about , superstitions .


Military people are very superstitious , like many of us are .
1,1,0,0 ORG-AFF

Here at this particular base they get their MREs , their MREs are their Meals Ready to Eat .
5,5,0,0 PHYS

They come in a bag .


And when you get an MRE you get your meal and you get a little treat with it .


What a lot of people here at this base do , when their treat happens to be this one , this is the candy called Charms , many of the people refuse to eat their Charms .
4,4,5,5 PHYS

They consider it a good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat them .


So one little superstitious tale for you , Judy .


Back to you .


WOODRUFF


Well , I 'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions .


Gary , one another quick question for you .


That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya .
2,2,12,12 PHYS|5,5,3,3 ART|5,5,4,4 ORG-AFF

Are you able to say , are they actually using it or getting much use out of it ?
7,7,10,10 ART

TUCHMAN


What they are doing , Judy , some of these A-10s behind me go there to refuel , to stage operations further north .


They also fly these HH-60 helicopters , they 're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground .
0,0,5,5 ART

They stage there and refuel .
0,0,2,2 PHYS

But right now , none of them are permanently based there , although the plan is for that to eventually happen .

`` I am sorry , '' he said .


`` No Answer . ''


`` No comment at all .


This is my last word to you , '' he told hordes of journalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence and U.N . headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the secretary-general , his future and the war .

Asked who should govern Iraq , Al-Douri said : `` I have nothing to do with that . ''


Annan also declined to comment on Thursday 's meeting with Al-Douri .


With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday , Al-Douri declared `` the game is over '' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace .


He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad .


Beside meeting with Annan , Al-Douri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the Delegate 's Lounge .

`` Defecting from who ? ''


he asked .


`` I think the government has already defected .


There is no more Iraqi government to be defected from . ''


Annan said early Thursday _ before meeting Al-Douri _ that in talks with the envoy Monday , `` he did n't ask for an asylum or protection ... ( and ) he did n't ask me for help with his status . ''


`` We did talk about what happens , depending on the evolution of things on the ground , '' Annan said .


The ambassador had vehemently defended his country for months as the United States and its allies sought U.N .

Frenetic merger and acquisition activity does n't mean much in the early days of a business -- it 's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early .


But when an outsider buys into the business once it 's established itself as important , but before it 's really gotten profitable , it 's big news .

New Questions About Attacking Iraq ; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary ?


NOVAK


Former Arkansas Governor and U.S . Senator Dale Bumpers has just published a memoir called " The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town . "
2,2,1,1 ORG-AFF|6,6,4,4 ORG-AFF

And it spans his life from the depression era to the Clinton era .


Let ' s ask him which was more depressing .


BEGALA


First , thank you for writing this book .


It is extraordinary .


It is wonderful .


And then we read you one passage .


You cite a session you had with President Lyndon Johnson in Austin , I guess , at his ranch , right ?
4,4,11,11 PHYS|8,9,11,11 PHYS|0,0,18,18 PHYS|8,9,18,18 PHYS

Here is what you quote our President Johnson to you . "


When I was majority leader , and later president , I spent all my time pulling every power string I could find to pull , trying to pass bills that helped people .


That made their lives better and the country stronger .


That 's what the Democrats stand for . " "


Republicans ?


Republicans just stand for two things : protecting the rich and investigation Democrats . "


That 's true , though , is n't it ?


Johnson was right , was n't he ?


BUMPER


I thought that was one of the most prescient things I ever heard , and that was long before White Water .


BEGALA


Yes .


He never heard of Ken Starr , but he anticipated it .


BUMPERS


Nothing ever changes , Paul .


NOVAK


Can I interrupt this Democratic picnic for just a minute ?


You know , Senator , inadvertently , you gave support in this book to one of my pet political themes , which you probably do n't agree with .


On page 256 you say , " As the years went by " -- this is when you were in the Senate -- " less and less information was new , fewer and fewer arguments were fresh , and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome . " "
17,17,21,21 ORG-AFF

I was becoming almost as cynical as my constituents .
7,7,8,8 PER-SOC

I knew it was time to leave . "


Is n't that a great argument for term limits ?


I know very few senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their first term .


Should n't we limit them to two terms ?


BUMPERS


First of all , that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the United States Senate .
11,11,14,16 ORG-AFF

But I must say , that 's a pretty accurate statement .


But it has nothing do with term limits , in my opinion .


I think term limits is the worst idea I ever heard of .


( APPLAUSE )


BEGALA


Amen .


NOVAK


I tried at least .


BEGALA


Let me turn one more page , to page 257 , actually , right next door to where Bob was reading .


This struck me because you 've got the courage to say something that is heretical today and it 's music to my ears .


You say , " Partisanship has taken on an odious connotation , and it may indeed be shriller now than ever .


But we should n't lose sight of the fact that we have two political parties so people will have choices .
14,14,1,1 GEN-AFF

If everybody agreed on everything , it might be a tranquil society , but it surely would be a dole one , and certainly not certainly a good one . "


BUMPERS


You know , Paul , that 's the reason we have two parties , so people have a choice .
12,12,9,9 GEN-AFF

And I 've said many times , if we all agreed on everything , everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess , would n't we , Bob ?
14,14,19,19 PER-SOC

NOVAK


Senator Bumpers , of the 22 senators of the old confederacy , when I got to Washington with the Associated Press , 45 years ago , 22 of them were Democrats , nine were Republicans .
13,13,16,16 PHYS|13,13,19,20 ORG-AFF|6,6,10,10 GEN-AFF

Now 13 are Republicans and nine are Democrats .


And of the Democrats , I do n't think there is a real liberal .


Your last year in the Senate I had an interview with you and I wrote a column called " The Last Southern Liberal . "
0,0,5,5 ORG-AFF

BUMPERS


And I thank you .


It was a very flattering article , Bob .


NOVAK


And you said , I 'll quote it , you said , today 's Southern voters are " children of Democrats who are not swayed by the same things their mothers and fathers were .
15,15,14,14 GEN-AFF|18,18,20,20 PER-SOC|29,29,30,30 PER-SOC

They certainly are susceptible to the Republican message . "


That 's a good future for the Democratic Party in the South .
7,8,11,11 GEN-AFF

BUMPERS


Bob , I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know , first of all , we were -- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president , we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the Civil War .
7,7,10,10 PHYS|34,34,40,40 GEN-AFF

And we felt that Franklin Roosevelt was the first person who ever really acknowledged that the South had peculiar problems .


And from that time on , that 's the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11 confederate states , is because of the Civil War and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time .
14,14,18,18 GEN-AFF|18,18,17,17 PART-WHOLE

Of course there was always that old story about the Yankees , and Yankees were synonymous with Republicans .


But that 's all changed and memories have dimmed .


And people , you know , they do n't remember that .


And so the message , the Republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make their case and they 've done it successfully .


And the Democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that , and they need to get a message and stay on it .


I mean we can not be all over the lot .


( CROSSTALK )


NOVAK


( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) they 're just not buying the new deal anymore in the South .
3,3,14,14 PHYS

Is n't that the truth ?


BUMPERS


Well , that 's true .


They 're not buying a new deal .


But I 'll tell you the message the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age , I mean within reach of the golden age , where everybody has health care , where everybody gets a good education -- you know I 'm one of the million and a half people -- my brother went to Harvard , I went to Northwestern University .
63,63,64,64 PER-SOC|69,69,72,73 ORG-AFF|64,64,67,67 ORG-AFF

Two schools my father could n't have even thought about affording .
2,2,3,3 PER-SOC

A million and a half veterans came out of War World II on the GI bill and got that kind of an education .


If that makes me a liberal , because I believe the government has a role to play in that , then I am a certified liberal , because I think that made the country stronger .


I think certainly it made every one of those people stronger , and I think we ought to be doing it right now .


No child in this country ought to be deprived of an education for lack of money .
1,1,4,4 GEN-AFF

No elderly person ought to have to make a choice between food and medicine .


And they do it by the millions every day .


And now ...

I 'll chair a committee .

Dale Bumpers for president , ladies and gentlemen .


Thank you very much .

It 's Just Armor


Scott


2004-12-08T21 :33:00


Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q&amp;A with the troops today that was anything but cozy .


Disgruntled soldiers complained to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and other equipment .


From the Associated Press : " You go to war with the Army you have , " Rumsfeld replied , " not the Army you might want or wish to have . "


Spc .


Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary , " Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles ? "
30,30,31,31 ART

Shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see Rumsfeld . "


We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north , " Wilson , 31 , of Nashville , Tenn .
19,19,21,21 PART-WHOLE|10,10,6,6 ART|14,14,19,19 GEN-AFF

Wilson , an airplane mechanic whose unit , the 278th Regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard , is about to drive north into Iraq for a one-year tour of duty , put his finger on a problem that has bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year .
5,5,6,6 ORG-AFF

Rarely , though , is it put so bluntly in a public forum .


Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can .
3,3,14,14 ART|3,3,17,17 ART

What is more , he said , armor is not the savior some think it is . "


You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can ( still ) be blown up , " he said .


Ca n't say that 's the most comforting answer .

Well , from what we hear from sources in Baghdad this evening , it had been mostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in Baghdad .


Then there was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists are staying in in the center of Baghdad .

What we 're hearing from Iraqi people in the capital today is that they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest of the city , in the southeast of the city .

Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife 's work in divorce case


BRIDGEPORT , Connecticut ( AP )
0,0,2,2 PART-WHOLE

Retired General Electric Co . Chairman Jack Welch is seeking work-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakes divorce case .
5,5,1,3 ORG-AFF|13,13,15,15 PER-SOC

The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago , shortly after Suzy Wetlaufer _ then editor of the Harvard Business Review _ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him .
17,17,20,22 ORG-AFF|13,14,31,31 PER-SOC

In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York , Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak , a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling in New York .
9,9,7,7 PART-WHOLE|9,9,11,12 GEN-AFF|26,26,30,30 ORG-AFF|30,30,36,37 GEN-AFF

He also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley Welch 's personnel file by Shearman &amp; Sterling , a prestigious corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch .
31,31,29,29 PER-SOC|9,11,16,18 ORG-AFF

Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations , correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm 's office in London , and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner .
20,20,22,22 ART|22,22,24,24 PART-WHOLE|9,9,11,11 PER-SOC

Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch 's salary , benefits , retirement plan and other compensation paid to her .


Michael York , one of Jack Welch 's attorneys , called the move routine .


A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential .


Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage .
11,11,20,20 ORG-AFF

The court order was requested by Jack Welch 's attorney , Daniel K. Webb , who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings , his health and entries in his personal diary .


Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches ' previous marriages were likely to come up , and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both .


Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a financial affidavit .


That document detailed monthly outlays of some $ 51,000 for upkeep on a half-dozen houses scattered from Massachusetts to Florida , more than $ 52,000 for gifts and nearly $ 9,000 for food and drink , among other expenses .

let ' s talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon .

she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq .
26,27,25,25 ORG-AFF|37,37,39,39 PART-WHOLE

do you think the administration underestimated the day after ?


i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way .


i think that there 's been a pattern here not just with this administration , but over the last ten years , bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , where we do n't quite recognize when the old order collapses , you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order .


in the short-term , that 's going to have to mean the american military .
13,13,12,12 GEN-AFF

but the key question , which i try to address in the book , is what do you do after that ?


what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition .


and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?
9,9,8,8 GEN-AFF

there 's no proof of that .


well , the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections .


but if you hold elections , you stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration .


we 've seen in the past in bosnia for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy .
20,20,7,7 GEN-AFF

there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority , but the faster you get that , the more likely you stop this process .


so what do you think of this interim government ?


you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process .
12,12,11,11 PART-WHOLE|12,12,9,9 PART-WHOLE

is that going to work ?


i think it will work if it 's truly broad-based and truly consensual , try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years .

From Reuters : U.S . Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair-trigger circumstances .
5,5,3,3 ORG-AFF|16,16,21,21 PHYS|9,9,21,21 PHYS

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they did n't see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city . "
21,21,34,34 PHYS

I can see why he would do it .


He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja .
0,0,13,13 PHYS

There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances , " said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson . "


I would have shot the insurgent too .


Two shots to the head , " said Sergeant Nicholas Graham , 24 , of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . "
9,10,15,15 GEN-AFF|15,15,17,17 PART-WHOLE

You ca n't trust these people .


He should not be investigated .


He did nothing wrong . "


Of course the anti- American world press is jumping all over this story , casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives .


Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings , and it 's clear to say that the Geneva Convention is n't on the minds of the insurgents .


For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush .


I 'm no fan of this war either , but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable recliners .


To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States : You do n't have to like our president or those operating this war , but get off the backs of the 18 , 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation you will never see or have to encounter .


I 've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well , and I will support them at every opportunity .

i was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , saddam hussein made the only self criticism .

he said , i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon .


maybe before the weapon and then later he said , oh , i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded .


he was right about that .


but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen-year 's war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in '91 when it could have been finished .


should have taken the side of the rebels then .


taken the risk of supporting a shiite insurrection at that point .


helping the kurds , removing the regime .


absolutely .


we 'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we 'd done that .


that seems to be the core of the argument .

There 's Always Plan B


Scott


2005-01-16T21 :49:00


The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription .


The FDA may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women age 16 and older .


Here is where I break with my conservative base and support the availability of Plan B which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex .


With an 89 % success rate , we can be optimistic that we are on the right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that does n't involve a scalpel or suction tube .


Conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky and unprotected sex if they 've got a box of B under the nightstand where condoms traditionally collect .


But I would rather Plan B be used to prevent pregnancy than the liberals ' preferred method ; a fork in the head and a knife to the spinal cord .

Casino Stock Is n't Quite Blue-Chip


Byrne


2004-12-15T21 :28:00


Back in the day ( 2000-2003 or so ) some of the hottest non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits .


Now , all that reinvestment has paid off , and , along with a good dose of consolidation , made the industry moderately hot again .


Like every boom , whether merited or not , the big companies have big moves in the early stage , but it does n't get attention or turn into a mania until we see a frenetic IPO or two .


You know where this is going : Las Vegas Sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60 % gain after a last-minute increase in offering price to $ 29 a share , outside the $ 24 - $ 26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $ 20 - $ 22 estimate .


But , well , the business is complicated and the business is tough .


Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license that captured investors 's attention during the IPO , illustrates this well enough : Steve Wynn , the company 's founder , made a gigantic fortune when he bet his company 's future on Atlantic City .
30,30,28,28 ORG-AFF|39,39,40,40 ORG-AFF|40,40,44,45 GEN-AFF

When investors saw his $ 160 million all-debt investment turn into a $ 440 million asset in just a few years -- his net worth took a similar , though even less gravitationally-bound arc , rising from $ 2 million to $ 75 million durign the same time ) they all rushed in .


Needless to say , Wynn sold when everyone else bought , and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90 's .


So , applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such spectacular sums for your broad-scoped ambitions .


And a premature apology to the newly-minted shareholders , who will doubtless see some eye-popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the current one .


Full disclosure , just for the hell of it : I was bearish about the Google IPO , too .


Thank God I did n't sell short

Amazon ended the day down 14.6 % .


Starbucks down 8.2 % .


I should disclose that I spent a few years living in Seattle and I have a soft spot in my heart for all things Seattle .
4,4,11,11 GEN-AFF

As far as I could tell , many people in the Northwest spend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinking microbrews .
8,8,11,11 GEN-AFF

Really not a bad lifestyle .


Anyway , back on topic here .


Market over reaction ?


Hard to say .


Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth .


Yesterday 's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies .


Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .


I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday .


However , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .


This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio .


A couple weeks ago , I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .


Starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .


Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators .


Not surprising are it s strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators .


It s weakest score is in the external reporting indicator .


In the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .


The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .
18,18,8,8 PART-WHOLE

This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .


Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis , several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .


1 .


Starbucks has little debt .


Starbucks is not currently financing it s growth with debt .


Considering it s growth , this is amazing .


It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth .


The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting it s risk profile because ...


2 .


Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position .


This allows the company to grow without debt .


You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders .


This option is another way that Starbucks has retained it s flexibility for the future .


3 .


Starbucks is the primary owner of it s stores and limits franchising .
6,6,8,8 ART

While Starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , Barnes &amp; Noble ) , most of it s stores are company owned .
16,16,18,18 ART

From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .


Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .


I can not say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than the industry norm .


Risk is lower .


Interesting aside : Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme .
8,8,11,11 PART-WHOLE|3,3,8,8 ART|17,18,8,8 ART|10,10,11,11 GEN-AFF

Disclosure : At the time of this writing I do not own Starbucks stock ... but I am tempted and might consider a buy next week .


I am also tempted to go buy a latte after writing this post .

Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer 's Attila the Hun - like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators , who will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their own demands .


Interestingly enough , this morning 's Wall Street Journal reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $ 850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt .


The rhetoric we 're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- does n't match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been .


Crazy .


Full Disclosure : I own shares of Marsh , and I would not be particularly dissapointed if Eliot Spitzer 's career took a sudden nosedive thanks to , say , questions about his business relationship to money manager and alleged stock manipulator Jim Cramer .

Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code .

It all seems perfect and yet ... Oh , I 'm so thankful to be somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people 's lives , and I want to keep an open mind and hope it 'll last forever , but I have a feeling I 'll be restless within a year or so .

We 'll see .


I 'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get , but it 's the best salary I 've gotten thus far .


When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less , but I got quite a few remotes , which make up for not getting a topnotch salary .


I 'm still doing my TV announcing and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .


I 'm going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so , too .

It 's almost bad making some money now , because while most of me wants to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff !!!

From the Associated Press : An atheist who tried to remove " under God " from the Pledge of Allegiance lost a bid Friday to bar the saying of a Christian prayer at President Bush 's inauguration .


Newdow argued that saying a Christian prayer at the Jan. 20 ceremony would violate the Constitution by forcing him to accept unwanted religious beliefs .


Attorneys representing Bush and his inaugural committee argued that prayers have been widely accepted at inaugurals for more than 200 years and that Bush 's decision to have a minister recite the invocation was a personal choice the court had no power to prevent .

Courts Say ' No ' to Choose Life Plates

From the Associated Press : The Supreme Court declined Monday to consider whether states may offer license plates with anti-abortion messages , leaving lower courts divided over whether the programs in a dozen states unconstitutionally restrict dissenting views .


Without comment , justices let stand a lower court ruling that said South Carolina 's license plates , which bear the slogan " Choose Life , " violate the First Amendment because abortion rights supporters were n't given a similar forum to express their beliefs .


Say what ??


Now the First Amendment guarantees all sides a fair voice ?


Where were liberals when Ralf Nader wanted such equality ?


And who on Earth could possibly have a problem with someone who paid $ 70 that went to a local crisis pregnancy program for an anti-abortion license plate ?

Budget cinema launched by eastJet founder finally gets some films


LONDON , May 9 ( AFP )


A ground-breaking British budget cinema chain launched by the founder of low-cost airline easyJet announced Friday that it had finally acquired some films to show -- just a fortnight before it first opens .
9,9,5,5 ORG-AFF|9,9,13,13 ORG-AFF|5,5,2,2 GEN-AFF|9,9,4,4 ART

EasyCinema , which aims to sell tickets to its no-frills cinemas for as little as 20 pence ( 0.28 euros , 0.32 dollars ) , has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles .
10,10,8,8 PART-WHOLE

Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors , easyCinema wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first-run movies over a fixed period , a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors .


EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou , who set up easyJet in 1995 and built it up into Europe 's biggest budget airline , has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access .
1,1,0,0 ORG-AFF|5,5,8,8 ORG-AFF

The deadlock , and subsequent lack of any films , has been threatening to de-rail the debut of easyCinema 's first outlet in Milton Keynes , just north of London , which is due to open its doors on May 23 .
21,21,18,18 PART-WHOLE|21,21,23,24 GEN-AFF|23,24,29,29 PHYS

While not the latest Hollywood blockbusters , these include titles such as as recently-released US martial arts picture " Bulletproof Monk " and new British 1930s-based weepie " The Heart of Me " .


Haji-Ioannou professed himself " delighted " , but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors . "


The situation with the top six UK distributors representing more than 90 percent of the market is still in a deadlock , " he said . "

EasyCinema aims to make its money by drawing the public in with rock-bottom prices during off-peak hours , when traditional cinemas are often almost empty , also giving the biggest discounts to tickets bought long in advance .

The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks .


The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet 's acceptance of the U.S .
12,12,14,15 ORG-AFF|10,10,14,15 ORG-AFF

- backed `` road map '' peace plan .


Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could endanger Israel 's existence .
16,16,19,20 PART-WHOLE

Skeptics , however , wondered whether Sharon 's conversion was a shrewd effort to deflect U.S .


pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before Israel had to make tough concessions .


`` To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them , '' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio .


The term `` occupation '' is anathema to the Israeli right , which believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious and security reasons .
10,10,9,9 GEN-AFF|24,25,14,14 PART-WHOLE|21,22,14,14 PART-WHOLE

Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word `` occupation '' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements .

Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state .

On Sunday , Sharon 's Cabinet conditionally approved the `` road map , '' a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005 .

Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict , including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers .

`` This ca n't continue endlessly .

Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the Palestinians and endangers Israel .
1,1,0,0 ORG-AFF

In his remarks Monday , Sharon left himself an out .


`` What will happen if Palestinian terror continues ?


Nothing .


Nothing will happen .


The Palestinians will get nothing , '' he said .


Critics have said Sharon 's long-held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative , including the road map , thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks .


Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the U.S .


government that he was committed to the plan , while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end U.S .

`` Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog , because then no one knows where he is headed , '' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily .

Hello , again , Jamie .


JAMIE MCINTYRE , CNN SNR .


MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT


Well Judy , the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it had n't seen for awhile .


First of all , as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN , the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S . troops , that taking place in Najaf .
18,18,23,23 GEN-AFF|28,28,26,26 ORG-AFF|18,18,34,34 PHYS|28,28,34,34 PHYS

Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S . troops arrived , both in Karbala and also in Al Kut .
27,27,32,32 PHYS|27,27,36,37 PHYS|22,22,20,21 ORG-AFF|27,27,25,25 ORG-AFF

They met lighter than expected resistance .


But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so - called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons , and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon .

MAJOR GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL , JOINT CHIEFS , VICE DIR .


We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains , or anything like that .

So , in regard to that , we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground .


They may just suddenly be effective on the ground .


Additionally , their ability to use chemical and biological weapons , they 've proven it historically .
2,2,9,9 ART

We believe they have the capability now .


Clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which Baghdad and Tikrit represent , we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up .

Jamie , these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago .


Is there a chance that coalition forces could , at this point , be overestimating the strength of what 's left of the opposition ?
6,6,5,5 ORG-AFF

MCINTYRE


Well , they might be .


And that might be a good thing .


They are taking it very cautiously .


No one , again , they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead .


Could be urban combat .


Could involve chemical weapons .


Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad .
8,8,11,11 PHYS

Could be a very dangerous time .


They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed , they do n't mean every single person has been killed .


Simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy .

We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed , in fact , they said let others do that .
